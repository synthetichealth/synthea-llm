Beta blockers can be used for symptomatic relief. | The module correctly implements TI resolution within 1-6 months. However, it doesnt explicitly mention beta blocker use for TI. | The Thyroiditis_Resolution state delays for 1-6 months before ending the TI condition. | Add beta blocker prescription option for TI patients. | 0.75 |\n| 34 | If overt GD is present, treatment with antithyroid drugs (ATDs) (e.g., methimazole 5-40 mg/d, propylthiouracil 50-150 mg 3 times daily) is first-line therapy, except in cases of severe TNG or severe ophthalmopathy, in which case surgical intervention is the preferred first-line therapy. After 15 months of treatment with ATDs, there will be remission in 45% of cases, after which, ATDs are discontinued. | The module implements ATD treatment for GD and surgical intervention for severe TNG or ophthalmopathy. It also models ATD treatment duration and remission rates correctly. | The Treatment_Decision state leads to either Prescribe_Antithyroid_Drugs or Delay_For_Surgery based on the condition. The Evaluate_Antithyroid_Drug_Remission state models the 45% remission rate after 15 months. | None | 1.0 |\n| 35 | For patients prescribed ATDs, monitoring of thyroid hormones (T3 and FT4) is done monthly for the first 3 months from the initial treatment. | The module implements monthly monitoring of T3 and FT4 for the first 3 months of ATD treatment. | The Antithyroid_Drug_Monitoring state delays for 1 month and leads to Followup_Encounter_1, which includes T3 and FT4 testing. This process repeats for 3 months. | None | 1.0 |\n| 36 | The relapse rate after discontinuation of ATDs is 40% within the first year and 60% within 5 years. | The module correctly implements the relapse rates after ATD discontinuation. | The Check_For_Relapse state has a 40% chance of Hyperthyroidism_Relapse within the first year. The Check_For_Second_Relapse state has a 60% chance of Hyperthyroidism_Relapse within 5 years. | None | 1.0 |\n| 37 | If ATD therapy fails to achieve remission after 15 months, or if HT recurs after discontinuation of ATDs, the patient will next receive radioactive iodine therapy (RAI). RAI achieves remission in 85% of cases. | The module implements RAI therapy for ATD failure or recurrence, but doesnt specify the 85% remission rate. | The Evaluate_Antithyroid_Drug_Remission state leads to Radioactive_Iodine_Therapy if remission is not achieved.

Severity between 20% and 79% is considered mild to moderate, and above 80% is considered severe. | The module implements this in the "Hyperthyroidism_Symptom_12" state with a probability of 0.33 and a severity range of 20-100%. However, it does not differentiate between mild/moderate and severe cases. | The transition from "Hyperthyroidism_Symptom_11" to "Hyperthyroidism_Symptom_12" partially implements this requirement. | Modify the "Hyperthyroidism_Symptom_12" state to categorize severity: 20-79% as mild/moderate and 80-100% as severe. This categorization should be used in later decision-making processes. | 0.75 |\n| 23 | All patients presenting symptoms of HT should first be tested for T3 and FT4 levels. If subclinical HT is present, then T3 and FT4 tests will be normal. If overt HT is present, tests will reveal elevated T3 and/or elevated FT4. | The module implements this in the "Order_T3_and_FT4" state. However, it does not model subclinical HT, and always sets T3 and FT4 to "High". | The transition from "Initial_Encounter" to "Order_T3_and_FT4" correctly implements the testing, but the results are not variable as required. | Modify the "Order_T3_and_FT4" state to allow for normal results (subclinical HT) and elevated results (overt HT). Add logic to differentiate between subclinical and overt HT based on these results. | 0.5 |\n| 24 | If initial or follow-up testing reveals overt HT, and palpable thyroid nodules are present, or physiologic signs of GD are unclear, then TRAbs should be measured next. | The module implements this in the "Assess_For_Goiter" state, which checks for goiter and nodules. If present, it transitions to "Order_TRAbs". | The transitions from "Assess_For_Goiter" to "Order_TRAbs" correctly implement this requirement. | None | 1.0 |\n| 25 | However, if initial or follow-up testing reveals overt HT and there are no palpable thyroid nodules and there are clear physiologic signs of GD, TRAbs testing is not necessary, and a diagnosis of GD is confirmed. | The module implements this in the "Assess_For_Goiter" state. If ophthalmopathy is present and no nodules are detected, it transitions directly to "Graves_Disease_Diagnosis". | The transition from "Assess_For_Goiter" to "Graves_Disease_Diagnosis" correctly implements this requirement. | None | 1.0 |\n| 26 | If TRAbs are elevated, a GD diagnosis is confirmed. TRAbs will be elevated in 98% of cases of GD. | The module implements this in the "Evaluate_TRAbs" state. However, it does not specify the 98% probability for elevated TRAbs in GD cases. | The transition from "Evaluate_TRAbs" to "Graves_Disease_Diagnosis" implements this requirement, but without the specified probability. | Modify the "Evaluate_TRAbs" state to include a 98% probability of elevated TRAbs for GD cases. | 0.75 |\n| 27 | Alternatively, if TRAbs are normal, radioactive iodine uptake test (RAIU) should be conducted. However, RAIU is contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation, and a thyroid ultrasound with color-flow Doppler procedure should be substituted. | The module implements this in the "Order_RAIU" state, which checks for pregnancy or lactation and transitions to "Thyroid_Ultrasound" if present, otherwise to "Radioactive_Iodine_Uptake". | The transitions from "Order_RAIU" to either "Thyroid_Ultrasound" or "Radioactive_Iodine_Uptake" correctly implement this requirement. | None | 1.0 |\n| 28 | If GD is present, RAIU will reveal diffusely increased uptake in 95% of cases, and then GD diagnosis is confirmed. | The module implements this in the "Evaluate_RAIU" state. If the RAIU result is "Diffuse" and the likely diagnosis is Graves Disease, it transitions to "Graves_Disease_Diagnosis" with a 95% probability. | The transition from "Evaluate_RAIU" to "Graves_Disease_Diagnosis" correctly implements this requirement. | None | 1.0 |\n| 29 | Alternatively, if TNG is present, RAIU will reveal focal areas of increased uptake, and then TNG diagnosis is confirmed. Nodules revealed by ultrasound likewise indicate the presence of TNG. | The module implements this in the "Evaluate_RAIU" and "Evaluate_Ultrasound" states. If RAIU result is "Focal" or ultrasound reveals nodules, it transitions to "Toxic_Nodular_Goiter_Diagnosis". | The transitions from "Evaluate_RAIU" and "Evaluate_Ultrasound" to "Toxic_Nodular_Goiter_Diagnosis" correctly implement this requirement. | None | 1.0 |\n| 30 | Alternatively, if TI is present, RAIU will reveal low or absent uptake, and a diagnosis of TI can be confirmed. | The module implements this in the "Evaluate_RAIU" state. If RAIU result is "Low" and the likely diagnosis is Thyroiditis, it transitions to "Thyroiditis_Diagnosis". | The transition from "Evaluate_RAIU" to "Thyroiditis_Diagnosis" correctly implements this requirement. | None | 1.0 |\n| 31 | If subclinical HT is present (i.e., T3 and FT4 tests are normal), a period of "watchful waiting" commences, during which the T3 and FT4 should be tested at 4-month intervals. For these patients, 3.5% will progress to overt HT per year. | The module does not implement subclinical HT or the watchful waiting period. | There are no transitions related to subclinical HT or watchful waiting. | Add states to model subclinical HT, including periodic testing and potential progression to overt HT. | 0.0 |\n| 32 | Beta-blockers are used for symptomatic relief in 75% of HT patients during initial disease management, particularly those suffering from tachycardia or anxiety. | The module implements this in the "Beta_Blocker_Decision" state, which has a 75% probability of transitioning to "Prescribe_Beta_Blocker". | The transitions from "Beta_Blocker_Decision" to either "Prescribe_Beta_Blocker" or "Antithyroid_Drug_Monitoring" correctly implement this requirement. | None | 1.0 |\n| 33 | If TI is present, the condition will resolve itself naturally in 1-6 months. Beta blockers can be used for symptomatic relief. | The module implements this in the "Thyroiditis_Resolution" state, which delays for 1-6 months before transitioning to "End_Thyroiditis". However, it does not explicitly model the use of beta blockers for symptomatic relief in TI cases. | The transition from "Thyroiditis_Resolution" to "End_Thyroiditis" correctly implements the natural resolution of TI. | Add a state to prescribe beta blockers for symptomatic relief in TI cases before the "Thyroiditis_Resolution" state. | 0.75 |\n| 34 | If overt GD is present, treatment with antithyroid drugs (ATDs) (e.g., methimazole 5-40 mg/d, propylthiouracil 50-150 mg 3 times daily) is first-line therapy, except in cases of severe TNG or severe ophthalmopathy, in which case surgical intervention is the preferred first-line therapy. After 15 months of treatment with ATDs, there will be remission in 45% of cases, after which, ATDs are discontinued. | The module partially implements this in the "Treatment_Decision" state, which transitions to "Prescribe_Antithyroid_Drugs" for most cases, and to "Delay_For_Surgery" for severe TNG or severe ophthalmopathy. The "Evaluate_Antithyroid_Drug_Remission" state models a 45% remission rate after treatment. However, the treatment duration is not explicitly set to 15 months. | The transitions from "Treatment_Decision" to either "Prescribe_Antithyroid_Drugs" or "Delay_For_Surgery", and from "Evaluate_Antithyroid_Drug_Remission" to either "End_Antithyroid_Drug_Treatment" or "Radioactive_Iodine_Therapy", partially implement this requirement. | Modify the "Evaluate_Antithyroid_Drug_Treatment" state to explicitly delay for 15 months before evaluating remission. | 0.75 |\n| 35 | For patients prescribed ATDs, monitoring of thyroid hormones (T3 and FT4) is done monthly for the first 3 months from the initial treatment. | The module implements this in the "Antithyroid_Drug_Monitoring" state, which delays for one month before a followup encounter. This is repeated up to three times. | The transitions between "Antithyroid_Drug_Monitoring", "Followup_Encounter_1", and "End_Followup_Encounter_1" correctly implement this requirement. | None | 1.0 |\n| 36 | The relapse rate after discontinuation of ATDs is 40% within the first year and 60% within 5 years. | The module implements this in the "Check_For_Relapse" and "Check_For_Second_Relapse" states. The first check has a 40% relapse rate, and the second check (4 years later) has a 60% relapse rate. | The transitions from "Check_For_Relapse" and "Check_For_Second_Relapse" to either "Hyperthyroidism_Relapse" or the next state correctly implement this requirement. | None | 1.0 |\n| 37 | If ATD therapy fails to achieve remission after 15 months, or if HT recurs after discontinuation of ATDs, the patient will next receive radioactive iodine therapy (RAI). RAI achieves remission in 85% of cases. | The module implements this in the "Evaluate_Antithyroid_Drug_Remission" and "Hyperthyroidism_Relapse" states, which both transition to "Radioactive_Iodine_Therapy". However, the 85% remission rate for RAI is not explicitly modeled. | The transitions to "Radioactive_Iodine_Therapy" correctly implement this requirement, but the remission rate is not modeled. | Add a state after "Radioactive_Iodine_Therapy" to model the 85% remission rate for RAI. | 0.75 |\n| 38 | Six months after the RAI therapy, the patients thyroid hormones will be retested. If overt HT persists, the 50% of patients will repeat RAI treatment, and other 50% of patients will move to the third-line therapy, surgical intervention. Patients who have received RAI twice but still have HT will also receive surgical intervention. | The module implements this in the "Delay_For_RAI_Evaluation", "Followup_Encounter_2", and "Repeat_RAI_Decision" states. If HT persists after RAI, theres a 50% chance of repeating RAI and a 50% chance of surgical intervention. | The transitions between these states correctly implement this requirement. | None | 1.0 |\n| 39 | Surgical intervention is needed for patients with severe TNG, patients with severe ophthalmopathy, and those for whom ATDs and RAI were ineffective. This is 7.5% of overt HT cases overall. Of surgical patients, 80% receive undergo thyroidectomy (procedure) and 20% receive RFA (procedure). Thyroidectomy has a cure rate of 95% and RFA has a success rate of 75%. Patients for whom RFA fails will subsequently undergo thyroidectomy. | The module implements this in the "Surgery_Decision", "Thyroidectomy", "Radiofrequency_Ablation", "Evaluate_Thyroidectomy", and "Evaluate_RFA" states. The distribution of procedures and their success rates are correctly modeled. | The transitions between these surgical states correctly implement this requirement. | None | 1.0 |\n| 40 | After successful RAI or surgical intervention (either thyroidectomy or RFA), the risk of hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone levels) is 85%. For these cases, levothyroxine (medication) is prescribed and continued indefinitely for the life of the patient. | The module implements this in the "Hypothyroidism_Risk" and "Hypothyroidism_Onset" states, with an 85% chance of developing hypothyroidism after treatment. If hypothyroidism develops, levothyroxine is prescribed in the "Prescribe_Levothyroxine" state. | The transitions from "Hypothyroidism_Risk" to either "Hypothyroidism_Onset" or "Annual_TSH_Monitoring", and from "Hypothyroidism_Onset" to "Prescribe_Levothyroxine", correctly implement this requirement. | None | 1.0 |\n| 41 | Long-term follow-up for overt HT involves annual TSH testing to monitor for recurrence of HT or development of hypothyroidism. | The module implements this in the "Annual_TSH_Monitoring", "TSH_Monitoring_Encounter", and "Evaluate_TSH_Followup" states, which model annual TSH testing and evaluation. | The transitions between these monitoring states correctly implement this requirement. | None | 1.0 |\n| 42 | 15% of patients with HT have uncontrolled disease, either because they lack access medical care, decline treatment, or are non-compliant with treatments. | The module implements this in the "Hyperthyroidism_Symptoms" state, which has a 15% chance of transitioning to "Uncontrolled_Hyperthyroidism". | The transition from "Hyperthyroidism_Symptoms" to "Uncontrolled_Hyperthyroidism" correctly implements this requirement. | None | 1.0 |\n| 43 | Long-term osteoporosis risk is increased by 25% in patients with uncontrolled HT. | The module implements this in the "Long_Term_Complications" state, which has a 25% chance of transitioning to "Osteoporosis" for patients with uncontrolled hyperthyroidism. | The transition from "Long_Term_Complications" to "Osteoporosis" correctly implements this requirement. | None | 1.0 |\n| 44 | The risk of atrial fibrillation in patients with uncontrolled HT is 12.5%, compared to 1-1.5% in the general population. | The module implements this in the "Long_Term_Complications" state, which has a 12.5% chance of transitioning to "Atrial_Fibrillation" for patients with uncontrolled hyperthyroidism. | The transition from "Long_Term_Complications" to "Atrial_Fibrillation" correctly implements this requirement. | None | 1.0 |\n| 45 | Long-term risk of cardiovascular mortality is increased by 25% in patients with uncontrolled HT. | The module implements this in the "Long_Term_Complications" state, which has a 25% chance of transitioning to "Cardiovascular_Death" for patients with uncontrolled hyperthyroidism. | The transition from "Long_Term_Complications" to "Cardiovascular_Death" correctly implements this requirement. | None | 1.0 |", "overall_score": 76.66666666666667, "review_df": [{"requirement_number": "1", "Requirement": "Risk of overt GD, women aged 15-60: 1.35%", "Explanation": "The module implements this in the "Delay_Until_Hyperthyroidism" state with a distributed transition probability of 0.01 for women aged 15-60 transitioning to Graves Disease.

However, the 98% probability is not explicitly implemented. | The transition goes from "Order_TRAbs" to "Evaluate_TRAbs", then potentially to "Graves_Disease_Diagnosis". | Add a distributed transition in "Evaluate_TRAbs" with a 98% probability of elevated TRAbs for GD cases. | 0.75 |\n| 27 | Alternatively, if TRAbs are normal, radioactive iodine uptake test (RAIU) should be conducted. However, RAIU is contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation, and a thyroid ultrasound with color-flow Doppler procedure should be substituted. | This requirement is implemented in the "Order_RAIU" state. The conditional transition correctly leads to "Thyroid_Ultrasound" if the patient is pregnant or lactating, and to "Radioactive_Iodine_Uptake" otherwise. | The transition goes from "Evaluate_TRAbs" to "Order_RAIU", then to either "Radioactive_Iodine_Uptake" or "Thyroid_Ultrasound". | None | 1.0 |\n| 28 | If GD is present, RAIU will reveal diffusely increased uptake in 95% of cases, and then GD diagnosis is confirmed. | This requirement is partially implemented in the "Evaluate_RAIU" state. The state correctly leads to "Graves_Disease_Diagnosis" if uptake is diffuse and the likely diagnosis is GD. However, the 95% probability is not explicitly implemented. | The transition goes from "Radioactive_Iodine_Uptake" to "Evaluate_RAIU", then potentially to "Graves_Disease_Diagnosis". | Adjust the distribution in "Evaluate_RAIU" to reflect the 95% probability of diffuse uptake in GD cases. | 0.75 |\n| 29 | Alternatively, if TNG is present, RAIU will reveal focal areas of increased uptake, and then TNG diagnosis is confirmed. Nodules revealed by ultrasound likewise indicate the presence of TNG. | This requirement is implemented in the "Evaluate_RAIU" and "Evaluate_Ultrasound" states. Both states correctly lead to "Toxic_Nodular_Goiter_Diagnosis" if focal uptake or nodules are present. | The transitions go from "Radioactive_Iodine_Uptake" to "Evaluate_RAIU" or from "Thyroid_Ultrasound" to "Evaluate_Ultrasound", then potentially to "Toxic_Nodular_Goiter_Diagnosis". | None | 1.0 |\n| 30 | Alternatively, if TI is present, RAIU will reveal low or absent uptake, and a diagnosis of TI can be confirmed. | This requirement is implemented in the "Evaluate_RAIU" state.

For these patients, 3.5% will progress to overt HT per year. | This requirement is partially implemented in the "Watchful_Waiting" and "Subclinical_HT_Followup_Encounter" states. The module correctly implements a watchful waiting period with follow-up testing. However, the 4-month interval and the 3.5% annual progression rate are not explicitly implemented. | The transitions go from "Treatment_Decision" to "Watchful_Waiting" to "Subclinical_HT_Followup_Encounter" in a loop. | Adjust the delay in "Watchful_Waiting" to 4 months and add logic to implement the 3.5% annual progression rate to overt HT. | 0.75 |\n| 32 | Beta-blockers are used for symptomatic relief in 75% of HT patients during initial disease management, particularly those suffering from tachycardia or anxiety. | This requirement is implemented in the "Beta_Blocker_Decision" and "Prescribe_Beta_Blocker" states. The distributed transition correctly assigns a 75% probability of prescribing beta-blockers. | The transition goes from "Prescribe_Antithyroid_Drugs" to "Beta_Blocker_Decision", then potentially to "Prescribe_Beta_Blocker". | None | 1.0 |\n| 33 | If TI is present, the condition will resolve itself naturally in 1-6 months. Beta blockers can be used for symptomatic relief. | This requirement is implemented in the "Thyroiditis_Resolution" state. The delay correctly ranges from 1 to 6 months. However, the use of beta-blockers for symptomatic relief is not explicitly implemented for TI cases. | The transition goes from "Treatment_Decision" to "Thyroiditis_Resolution" to "End_Thyroiditis". | Add a state to prescribe beta-blockers for symptomatic relief in TI cases before the "Thyroiditis_Resolution" state. | 0.75 |\n| 34 | If overt GD is present, treatment with antithyroid drugs (ATDs) (e.g., methimazole 5-40 mg/d, propylthiouracil 50-150 mg 3 times daily) is first-line therapy, except in cases of severe TNG or severe ophthalmopathy, in which case surgical intervention is the preferred first-line therapy. After 15 months of treatment with ATDs, there will be remission in 45% of cases, after which, ATDs are discontinued. | This requirement is partially implemented in the "Treatment_Decision", "Prescribe_Antithyroid_Drugs", and "Evaluate_Antithyroid_Drug_Remission" states. The module correctly prescribes ATDs for GD and considers surgery for severe cases. However, the 15-month treatment duration and 45% remission rate are not explicitly implemented. | The transitions go from "Treatment_Decision" to "Prescribe_Antithyroid_Drugs", then through monitoring states, and eventually to "Evaluate_Antithyroid_Drug_Remission". | Adjust the delay before "Evaluate_Antithyroid_Drug_Remission" to 15 months and set the remission probability to 45%. | 0.75 |\n| 35 | For patients prescribed ATDs, monitoring of thyroid hormones (T3 and FT4) is done monthly for the first 3 months from the initial treatment. | This requirement is partially implemented in the "Antithyroid_Drug_Monitoring" and "Followup_Encounter_1" states. However, the monthly frequency for the first 3 months is not explicitly implemented. | The transitions go from "Prescribe_Antithyroid_Drugs" to "Antithyroid_Drug_Monitoring" to "Followup_Encounter_1" in a loop. | Modify the "Antithyroid_Drug_Monitoring" state to occur monthly for the first 3 months, then transition to less frequent monitoring. | 0.75 |\n| 36 | The relapse rate after discontinuation of ATDs is 40% within the first year and 60% within 5 years. | This requirement is partially implemented in the "Check_For_Relapse" and "Check_For_Second_Relapse" states. The first-year relapse rate is correctly set to 40%, but the 5-year rate is not explicitly implemented. | The transitions go from "End_Antithyroid_Drug_Treatment" to "Delay_Until_Relapse_Check" to "Check_For_Relapse", then potentially to "Delay_Until_Second_Relapse_Check" to "Check_For_Second_Relapse". | Adjust the "Check_For_Second_Relapse" state to reflect a 60% cumulative relapse rate at 5 years. | 0.75 |\n| 37 | If ATD therapy fails to achieve remission after 15 months, or if HT recurs after discontinuation of ATDs, the patient will next receive radioactive iodine therapy (RAI). RAI achieves remission in 85% of cases. | This requirement is implemented in the "Evaluate_Antithyroid_Drug_Remission" and "Radioactive_Iodine_Therapy" states. However, the 85% remission rate for RAI is not explicitly implemented. | The transitions go from "Evaluate_Antithyroid_Drug_Remission" or "Hyperthyroidism_Relapse" to "Radioactive_Iodine_Therapy". | Add a distributed transition after "Radioactive_Iodine_Therapy" to reflect the 85% remission rate. | 0.75 |\n| 38 | Six months after the RAI therapy, the patients thyroid hormones will be retested. If overt HT persists, the 50% of patients will repeat RAI treatment, and other 50% of patients will move to the third-line therapy, surgical intervention. Patients who have received RAI twice but still have HT will also receive surgical intervention. | This requirement is partially implemented in the "Delay_For_RAI_Evaluation", "Followup_Encounter_2", and "Repeat_RAI_Decision" states. The 6-month delay and 50/50 split between repeat RAI and surgery are correctly implemented. However, the handling of patients who have received RAI twice is not explicitly implemented. | The transitions go from "Radioactive_Iodine_Therapy" to "Delay_For_RAI_Evaluation" to "Followup_Encounter_2" to "Order_T3_and_FT4_Followup_2" to "Evaluate_T3_and_FT4_Followup_2" to "Repeat_RAI_Decision". | Add logic to track the number of RAI treatments and automatically transition to surgery after two unsuccessful RAI treatments. | 0.75 |\n| 39 | Surgical intervention is needed for patients with severe TNG, patients with severe ophthalmopathy, and those for whom ATDs and RAI were ineffective. This is 7.5% of overt HT cases overall. Of surgical patients, 80% receive undergo thyroidectomy (procedure) and 20% receive RFA (procedure). Thyroidectomy has a cure rate of 95% and RFA has a success rate of 75%. Patients for whom RFA fails will subsequently undergo thyroidectomy. | This requirement is implemented in the "Surgery_Decision", "Thyroidectomy", "Radiofrequency_Ablation", "Evaluate_Thyroidectomy", and "Evaluate_RFA" states. The probabilities for thyroidectomy vs. RFA and their success rates are correctly implemented. | The transitions go from "Delay_For_Surgery" to "Surgery_Encounter" to "Surgery_Decision", then to either "Thyroidectomy" or "Radiofrequency_Ablation", followed by their respective evaluation states. | None | 1.0 |\n| 40 | After successful RAI or surgical intervention (either thyroidectomy or RFA), the risk of hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone levels) is 85%. For these cases, levothyroxine (medication) is prescribed and continued indefinitely for the life of the patient. | This requirement is implemented in the "Hypothyroidism_Risk", "Hypothyroidism_Onset", and "Prescribe_Levothyroxine" states. The 85% risk of hypothyroidism is correctly implemented. | The transitions go from "End_Surgery_Encounter" to "Hypothyroidism_Risk", then potentially to "Hypothyroidism_Onset" and "Prescribe_Levothyroxine". | None | 1.0 |\n| 41 | Long-term follow-up for overt HT involves annual TSH testing to monitor for recurrence of HT or development of hypothyroidism. | This requirement is implemented in the "Annual_TSH_Monitoring", "TSH_Monitoring_Encounter", "Order_TSH_Followup", and "Evaluate_TSH_Followup" states. The module correctly implements annual TSH testing and evaluation. | The transitions form a loop from "Annual_TSH_Monitoring" to "TSH_Monitoring_Encounter" to "Order_TSH_Followup" to "Evaluate_TSH_Followup" and back to "Annual_TSH_Monitoring". | None | 1.0 |\n| 42 | 15% of patients with HT have uncontrolled disease, either because they lack access medical care, decline treatment, or are non-compliant with treatments. | This requirement is implemented in the "Hyperthyroidism_Symptoms" state. The distributed transition correctly assigns 15% of patients to "Uncontrolled_Hyperthyroidism". | The transition goes from "Hyperthyroidism_Symptoms" to either "Hyperthyroidism_Symptom_1" (85%) or "Uncontrolled_Hyperthyroidism" (15%). | None | 1.0 |\n| 43 | Long-term osteoporosis risk is increased by 25% in patients with uncontrolled HT. | This requirement is partially implemented in the "Long_Term_Complications" state. The state includes a 25% probability of transitioning to "Osteoporosis". However, this is not explicitly compared to the general population risk. | The transition goes from "Uncontrolled_Hyperthyroidism" to "Long_Term_Complications", then potentially to "Osteoporosis". | Add logic to compare the osteoporosis risk to the general population risk to ensure its a 25% increase. | 0.75 |\n| 44 | The risk of atrial fibrillation in patients with uncontrolled HT is 12.5%, compared to 1-1.5% in the general population. | This requirement is partially implemented in the "Long_Term_Complications" state. The state includes a 12.5% probability of transitioning to "Atrial_Fibrillation".

However, RAIU is contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation, and a thyroid ultrasound with color-flow Doppler procedure should be substituted. | The module implements this in the "Order_RAIU" state. If the patient is pregnant or lactating, the module transitions to "Thyroid_Ultrasound" instead of "Radioactive_Iodine_Uptake". | The conditional transition in "Order_RAIU" leads to either "Radioactive_Iodine_Uptake" or "Thyroid_Ultrasound" based on these conditions. | none | 1.0 |\n| 27 | If GD is present, RAIU will reveal diffusely increased uptake in 95% of cases, and then GD diagnosis is confirmed. | The module implements this in the "Evaluate_RAIU" state. If the RAIU result is "Diffuse" and the likely diagnosis is Graves Disease, there is a 95% probability of transitioning to "Graves_Disease_Diagnosis". | The conditional transition in "Evaluate_RAIU" uses these probabilities to determine the next state if the conditions are met. | none | 1.0 |\n| 28 | Alternatively, if TNG is present, RAIU will reveal focal areas of increased uptake, and then TNG diagnosis is confirmed. Nodules revealed by ultrasound likewise indicate the presence of TNG. | The module implements this in the "Evaluate_RAIU" and "Evaluate_Ultrasound" states. If the RAIU result is "Focal" or if nodules are detected on ultrasound, and the likely diagnosis is toxic nodular goiter, the module transitions to "Toxic_Nodular_Goiter_Diagnosis". | The conditional transitions in "Evaluate_RAIU" and "Evaluate_Ultrasound" lead to "Toxic_Nodular_Goiter_Diagnosis" if these conditions are met. | none | 1.0 |\n| 29 | Alternatively, if TI is present, RAIU will reveal low or absent uptake, and a diagnosis of TI can be confirmed. | The module implements this in the "Evaluate_RAIU" state. If the RAIU result is "Low" and the likely diagnosis is thyroiditis, the module transitions to "Thyroiditis_Diagnosis". | The conditional transition in "Evaluate_RAIU" leads to "Thyroiditis_Diagnosis" if these conditions are met. | none | 1.0 |\n| 30 | If subclinical HT is present (i.e., T3 and FT4 tests are normal), a period of "watchful waiting" commences, during which the T3 and FT4 should be tested at 4-month intervals. For these patients, 3.5% will progress to overt HT per year. | The module implements this in the "Watchful_Waiting" state. It sets a 4-month delay and then uses a distributed transition with a 0.0117 probability (equivalent to 3.5% per year) of progressing to overt hyperthyroidism. | The transition from "Watchful_Waiting" to either "Prescribe_Antithyroid_Drugs" or "Subclinical_HT_Followup_Encounter" implements this progression. | none | 1.0 |\n| 31 | Beta-blockers are used for symptomatic relief in 75% of HT patients during initial disease management, particularly those suffering from tachycardia or anxiety. | The module implements this in the "Beta_Blocker_Decision" state.

Beta blockers can be used for symptomatic relief. | The module implements this in the "Thyroiditis_Resolution" state, which sets a delay of 1-6 months before transitioning to "End_Thyroiditis". The "Prescribe_Beta_Blocker" state is also accessible for thyroiditis patients. | The transition from "Thyroiditis" to "Prescribe_Beta_Blocker", and then the delay in "Thyroiditis_Resolution" before "End_Thyroiditis" implement this requirement. | none | 1.0 |\n| 33 | If overt GD is present, treatment with antithyroid drugs (ATDs) (e.g., methimazole 5-40 mg/d, propylthiouracil 50-150 mg 3 times daily) is first-line therapy, except in cases of severe TNG or severe ophthalmopathy, in which case surgical intervention is the preferred first-line therapy. After 15 months of treatment with ATDs, there will be remission in 45% of cases, after which, ATDs are discontinued. | The module implements this in the "Treatment_Decision" state. If the cause is not severe TNG or severe ophthalmopathy, it transitions to "Prescribe_Antithyroid_Drugs". The "Evaluate_Antithyroid_Drug_Remission" state then uses a 45% probability for remission after 15 months of treatment. | The conditional transition in "Treatment_Decision" and the distributed transition in "Evaluate_Antithyroid_Drug_Remission" implement this treatment pathway. | none | 1.0 |\n| 34 | For patients prescribed ATDs, monitoring of thyroid hormones (T3 and FT4) is done monthly for the first 3 months from the initial treatment. | The module implements this in the "Antithyroid_Drug_Monitoring", "Followup_Encounter_1", and "Order_T3_and_FT4_Followup" states. These states set up monthly follow-ups for the first three months. | The transitions between these states implement the monthly monitoring for the first three months. | none | 1.0 |\n| 35 | The relapse rate after discontinuation of ATDs is 40% within the first year and 60% within 5 years. | The module implements this in the "Check_For_Relapse" and "Check_For_Second_Relapse" states. "Check_For_Relapse" uses a 40% probability of relapse after one year, and "Check_For_Second_Relapse" uses a 60% cumulative probability of relapse after five years. | The distributed transitions in these states implement the relapse probabilities at the specified time points. | none | 1.0 |\n| 36 | If ATD therapy fails to achieve remission after 15 months, or if HT recurs after discontinuation of ATDs, the patient will next receive radioactive iodine therapy (RAI). RAI achieves remission in 85% of cases. | The module implements this in the "Evaluate_Antithyroid_Drug_Remission" and "Radioactive_Iodine_Therapy" states. If ATD therapy fails or HT recurs, the module transitions to RAI therapy. The "Evaluate_RAI_Remission" state then uses an 85% probability for remission. | The transitions between these states and the distributed transition in "Evaluate_RAI_Remission" implement this treatment pathway. | none | 1.0 |\n| 37 | Six months after the RAI therapy, the patients thyroid hormones will be retested. If overt HT persists, the 50% of patients will repeat RAI treatment, and other 50% of patients will move to the third-line therapy, surgical intervention. Patients who have received RAI twice but still have HT will also receive surgical intervention. | The module implements this in the "Delay_For_RAI_Evaluation", "Followup_Encounter_2", "Order_T3_and_FT4_Followup_2", "Evaluate_T3_and_FT4_Followup_2", and "Repeat_RAI_Decision" states. These states set up the retest after 6 months and decide on repeat RAI or surgery based on the specified probabilities. | The transitions between these states implement the retesting and decision-making process after RAI therapy. | none | 1.0 |\n| 38 | Surgical intervention is needed for patients with severe TNG, patients with severe ophthalmopathy, and those for whom ATDs and RAI were ineffective. This is 7.5% of overt HT cases overall. Of surgical patients, 80% receive undergo thyroidectomy (procedure) and 20% receive RFA (procedure). Thyroidectomy has a cure rate of 95% and RFA has a success rate of 75%. Patients for whom RFA fails will subsequently undergo thyroidectomy. | The module implements this in the "Treatment_Decision", "Surgery_Decision", "Thyroidectomy", "Radiofrequency_Ablation", "Evaluate_Thyroidectomy", and "Evaluate_RFA" states.

For these patients, 3.5% will progress to overt HT per year. | This requirement is implemented in the "Watchful_Waiting" state.

Theres a 40% chance of relapse in the first year and an additional 20% chance in the next 4 years. | The transitions from these states to "Hyperthyroidism_Relapse" implement these relapse rates. | none | 1.0 |\n| 36 | If ATD therapy fails to achieve remission after 15 months, or if HT recurs after discontinuation of ATDs, the patient will next receive radioactive iodine therapy (RAI). RAI achieves remission in 85% of cases. | This requirement is implemented in the "Evaluate_Antithyroid_Drug_Remission" and "Radioactive_Iodine_Therapy" states. If ATDs fail or HT recurs, patients receive RAI. The "Evaluate_RAI_Remission" state implements the 85% remission rate. | The transitions between these states implement this treatment pathway. | none | 1.0 |\n| 37 | Six months after the RAI therapy, the patients thyroid hormones will be retested. If overt HT persists, the 50% of patients will repeat RAI treatment, and other 50% of patients will move to the third-line therapy, surgical intervention. Patients who have received RAI twice but still have HT will also receive surgical intervention. | This requirement is implemented in the "Delay_For_RAI_Evaluation", "Followup_Encounter_2", "Order_T3_and_FT4_Followup_2", "Evaluate_T3_and_FT4_Followup_2", and "Repeat_RAI_Decision" states.

This is 7.5% of overt HT cases overall. Of surgical patients, 80% receive undergo thyroidectomy (procedure) and 20% receive RFA (procedure). Thyroidectomy has a cure rate of 95% and RFA has a success rate of 75%. Patients for whom RFA fails will subsequently undergo thyroidectomy. | This requirement is implemented in the "Surgery_Decision", "Thyroidectomy", "Radiofrequency_Ablation", "Evaluate_Thyroidectomy", and "Evaluate_RFA" states.
