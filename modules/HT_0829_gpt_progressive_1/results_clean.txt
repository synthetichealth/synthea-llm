However, it doesn\'t consider the presence of palpable thyroid nodules or unclear GD signs. | The transition from "Overt_HT" to "TRAb_Testing" for GD cases implements part of this requirement. | Add conditions to check for palpable thyroid nodules and unclear GD signs before transitioning to TRAb testing. | 0.5 |\n| 24 | However, if initial or follow-up testing reveals overt HT and there are no palpable thyroid nodules and there are clear physiologic signs of GD, TRAbs testing is not necessary, and a diagnosis of GD is confirmed. | The module does not implement this specific scenario.

However, RAIU is contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation, and a thyroid ultrasound with color-flow Doppler procedure should be substituted. | The module does not implement this requirement. There is no RAIU testing for cases with normal TRAbs, and no consideration of pregnancy or lactation. | There are no transitions implementing this requirement. | Add a new state for RAIU testing after TRAb_Testing for cases with normal TRAbs.

Nodules revealed by ultrasound likewise indicate the presence of TNG. | The module partially implements this in the "RAIU_Ultrasound" state for TNG cases, but does not distinguish between RAIU and ultrasound results. | The transition from "RAIU_Ultrasound" to "TNG_Treatment" implements this requirement, but without distinguishing between RAIU and ultrasound. | Separate RAIU and ultrasound into distinct states, and adjust transitions to reflect the different diagnostic criteria for each. | 0.5 |\n| 29 | Alternatively, if TI is present, RAIU will reveal low or absent uptake, and a diagnosis of TI can be confirmed. | The module implements this in the "RAIU_Testing_TI" state, which checks for low uptake to confirm TI diagnosis. | The transition from "RAIU_Testing_TI" to "TI_Treatment" correctly implements this requirement. | none | 1.0 |\n| 30 | If subclinical HT is present (i.e., T3 and FT4 tests are normal), a period of "watchful waiting" commences, during which the T3 and FT4 should be tested at 4-month intervals. For these patients, 3.5% will progress to overt HT per year. | The module implements this requirement in the "Subclinical_HT" and "Watchful_Waiting" states.

After 15 months of treatment with ATDs, there will be remission in 45% of cases, after which, ATDs are discontinued. | The module partially implements this requirement. ATD treatment is prescribed for GD in the "ATD_Treatment" state, and surgical intervention is considered for severe cases. However, the 15-month treatment duration and 45% remission rate are not implemented. | The transitions from "GD_Treatment" to either "ATD_Treatment" or "Surgical_Intervention" partially implement this requirement. | Add a 15-month delay after "ATD_Treatment" and implement a 45% chance of remission, with appropriate transitions for continuing treatment or discontinuing ATDs. | 0.5 |\n| 34 | For patients prescribed ATDs, monitoring of thyroid hormones (T3 and FT4) is done monthly for the first 3 months from the initial treatment. | The module does not implement this requirement. There is no monthly monitoring of thyroid hormones after ATD prescription. | There are no transitions implementing this requirement. | Add a new state for monthly thyroid hormone monitoring after "ATD_Treatment", with appropriate transitions back to treatment or to potential remission states. | 0.0 |\n| 35 | The relapse rate after discontinuation of ATDs is 40% within the first year and 60% within 5 years. | The module does not implement this requirement. There is no consideration of relapse after ATD discontinuation. | There are no transitions implementing this requirement. | Add new states to model the possibility of relapse after ATD discontinuation, with appropriate probabilities at 1 year (40%) and 5 years (60%). | 0.0 |\n| 36 | If ATD therapy fails to achieve remission after 15 months, or if HT recurs after discontinuation of ATDs, the patient will next receive radioactive iodine therapy (RAI). RAI achieves remission in 85% of cases. | The module does not implement this requirement. There is no consideration of RAI therapy after failed ATD treatment or recurrence. | There are no transitions implementing this requirement. | Add new states for RAI therapy after failed ATD treatment or recurrence, with an 85% chance of remission. | 0.0 |\n| 37 | Six months after the RAI therapy, the patient\'s thyroid hormones will be retested. If overt HT persists, the 50% of patients will repeat RAI treatment, and other 50% of patients will move to the third-line therapy, surgical intervention. Patients who have received RAI twice but still have HT will also receive surgical intervention. | The module does not implement this requirement. There is no consideration of follow-up testing after RAI or repeated RAI treatments. | There are no transitions implementing this requirement. | Add new states for follow-up testing after RAI, with appropriate transitions to repeated RAI (50%), surgical intervention (50%), or remission based on the test results. | 0.0 |\n| 38 | Surgical intervention is needed for patients with severe TNG, patients with severe ophthalmopathy, and those for whom ATDs and RAI were ineffective. This is 7.5% of overt HT cases overall. Of surgical patients, 80% receive undergo thyroidectomy (procedure) and 20% receive RFA (procedure). Thyroidectomy has a cure rate of 95% and RFA has a success rate of 75%. Patients for whom RFA fails will subsequently undergo thyroidectomy. | The module partially implements this requirement. Surgical intervention (thyroidectomy) is considered for severe cases, but the specific percentages, RFA option, and success rates are not implemented. | The transition to "Surgical_Intervention" exists, but doesn\'t fully capture the complexity of this requirement. | Expand the "Surgical_Intervention" state to include both thyroidectomy and RFA options, with appropriate probabilities and success rates. Add transitions for failed RFA cases to undergo thyroidectomy. | 0.5 |\n| 39 | After successful RAI or surgical intervention (either thyroidectomy or RFA), the risk of hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone levels) is 85%. For these cases, levothyroxine (medication) is prescribed and continued indefinitely for the life of the patient. | The module does not implement this requirement. There is no consideration of hypothyroidism risk after RAI or surgical intervention, nor is there prescription of levothyroxine. | There are no transitions implementing this requirement. | Add new states to check for hypothyroidism after successful RAI or surgical intervention, with an 85% chance of developing hypothyroidism. Include a state for prescribing levothyroxine in these cases. | 0.0 |\n| 40 | Long-term follow-up for overt HT involves annual TSH testing to monitor for recurrence of HT or development of hypothyroidism. | The module does not implement this requirement. There is no long-term follow-up or annual TSH testing. | There are no transitions implementing this requirement. | Add a new state for annual TSH testing, with appropriate transitions based on the test results (recurrence, hypothyroidism, or continued remission). | 0.0 |\n| 41 | 15% of patients with HT have uncontrolled disease, either because they lack access medical care, decline treatment, or are non-compliant with treatments. | The module does not implement this requirement.

analyze the Synthea module for Hyperthyroidism and provide a detailed review of how each requirement is implemented. I\'ll go through the requirements one by one, explaining how they are represented in the module, discussing relevant transitions, and suggesting any necessary changes. I\'ll also provide a score for each requirement based on its implementation.\n\n| Requirement Number | Requirement | Explanation | Transitions | Change | Score |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | Risk of overt GD, women aged 15-60: 1.35% | The module implements this requirement in the "Initial" state. For women aged 15-60, there\'s a 0.018 (1.8%) distribution to the "HRF_Check" state, which is close to but slightly higher than the required 1.35%. The "Incidence_Distribution" state then allocates 45% of these cases to GD, resulting in approximately 0.81% risk of overt GD for women aged 15-60. | The transition from "Initial" to "HRF_Check" and then to "Incidence_Distribution" correctly implements this requirement. | Adjust the initial distribution for women aged 15-60 from 0.018 to 0.015 to more accurately reflect the 1.35% risk of overt GD. | 0.75 |\n| 2 | Risk of overt TNG, women aged 15-60: 0.30% | The module partially implements this requirement. In the "Incidence_Distribution" state, 10.5% of HT cases in women aged 15-60 are allocated to TNG. However, the initial distribution needs adjustment to accurately reflect the 0.30% risk. | The transition from "Initial" to "HRF_Check" to "Incidence_Distribution" and then to "TNG_Onset" implements this requirement, but with incorrect probabilities. | Adjust the initial distribution and the TNG allocation in "Incidence_Distribution" to accurately reflect the 0.30% risk of overt TNG for women aged 15-60. | 0.5 |\n| 3 | Risk of overt TI, women aged 15-60: 0.13% | The module partially implements this requirement. In the "Incidence_Distribution" state, 4.5% of HT cases in women aged 15-60 are allocated to TI. However, the initial distribution needs adjustment to accurately reflect the 0.13% risk. | The transition from "Initial" to "HRF_Check" to "Incidence_Distribution" and then to "TI_Onset" implements this requirement, but with incorrect probabilities. | Adjust the initial distribution and the TI allocation in "Incidence_Distribution" to accurately reflect the 0.13% risk of overt TI for women aged 15-60. | 0.5 |\n| 4 | Risk of overt GD, women aged 60+: 0.77% | The module implements this requirement in the "Initial" state. For women aged 60+, there\'s a 0.012 (1.2%) distribution to the "HRF_Check" state. The "Incidence_Distribution" state then allocates 64% of these cases to GD, resulting in approximately 0.768% risk of overt GD for women aged 60+, which is very close to the required 0.77%. | The transition from "Initial" to "HRF_Check" and then to "Incidence_Distribution" correctly implements this requirement. | None | 1.0 |\n| 5 | Risk of overt TNG, women aged 60+: 0.36% | The module implements this requirement in the "Initial" state and "Incidence_Distribution" state. For women aged 60+, there\'s a 0.012 (1.2%) distribution to the "HRF_Check" state, and 30% of these cases are allocated to TNG, resulting in a 0.36% risk of overt TNG, which matches the requirement. | The transition from "Initial" to "HRF_Check" to "Incidence_Distribution" and then to "TNG_Onset" correctly implements this requirement. | None | 1.0 |\n| 6 | Risk of overt TI, women aged 60+: 0.07% | The module implements this requirement in the "Initial" state and "Incidence_Distribution" state. For women aged 60+, there\'s a 0.012 (1.2%) distribution to the "HRF_Check" state, and 6% of these cases are allocated to TI, resulting in a 0.072% risk of overt TI, which is very close to the required 0.07%. | The transition from "Initial" to "HRF_Check" to "Incidence_Distribution" and then to "TI_Onset" correctly implements this requirement. | None | 1.0 |\n| 7 | Risk of overt GD, men aged 15-60: 0.23% | The module partially implements this requirement. For men aged 15-60, there\'s a 0.0015 (0.15%) distribution to the "HRF_Check" state. The "Incidence_Distribution" state then allocates 11.5% of these cases to GD, resulting in approximately 0.01725% risk of overt GD for men aged 15-60, which is lower than the required 0.23%. | The transition from "Initial" to "HRF_Check" to "Incidence_Distribution" and then to "GD_Onset" implements this requirement, but with incorrect probabilities. | Adjust the initial distribution for men aged 15-60 and the GD allocation in "Incidence_Distribution" to accurately reflect the 0.23% risk of overt GD. | 0.5 |\n| 8 | Risk of overt TNG, men aged 15-60: 0.05% | The module partially implements this requirement. For men aged 15-60, there\'s a 0.0015 (0.15%) distribution to the "HRF_Check" state. The "Incidence_Distribution" state then allocates 2.5% of these cases to TNG, resulting in approximately 0.00375% risk of overt TNG for men aged 15-60, which is lower than the required 0.05%. | The transition from "Initial" to "HRF_Check" to "Incidence_Distribution" and then to "TNG_Onset" implements this requirement, but with incorrect probabilities. | Adjust the initial distribution for men aged 15-60 and the TNG allocation in "Incidence_Distribution" to accurately reflect the 0.05% risk of overt TNG. | 0.5 |\n| 9 | Risk of overt TI, men aged 15-60: 0.02% | The module partially implements this requirement. For men aged 15-60, there\'s a 0.0015 (0.15%) distribution to the "HRF_Check" state. The "Incidence_Distribution" state then allocates 1% of these cases to TI, resulting in approximately 0.0015% risk of overt TI for men aged 15-60, which is lower than the required 0.02%. | The transition from "Initial" to "HRF_Check" to "Incidence_Distribution" and then to "TI_Onset" implements this requirement, but with incorrect probabilities. | Adjust the initial distribution for men aged 15-60 and the TI allocation in "Incidence_Distribution" to accurately reflect the 0.02% risk of overt TI. | 0.5 |\n| 10 | Risk of overt GD, men aged 60+: 0.13% | The module implements this requirement in the "Initial" state and "Incidence_Distribution" state. For men aged 60+, there\'s a 0.0012 (0.12%) distribution to the "HRF_Check" state, and 6% of these cases are allocated to GD, resulting in a 0.0072% risk of overt GD, which is lower than the required 0.13%. | The transition from "Initial" to "HRF_Check" to "Incidence_Distribution" and then to "GD_Onset" implements this requirement, but with incorrect probabilities. | Adjust the initial distribution for men aged 60+ and the GD allocation in "Incidence_Distribution" to accurately reflect the 0.13% risk of overt GD. | 0.5 |\n| 11 | Risk of overt TNG, men aged 60+: 0.06% | The module implements this requirement in the "Initial" state and "Incidence_Distribution" state. For men aged 60+, there\'s a 0.0012 (0.12%) distribution to the "HRF_Check" state, and 3% of these cases are allocated to TNG, resulting in a 0.0036% risk of overt TNG, which is lower than the required 0.06%. | The transition from "Initial" to "HRF_Check" to "Incidence_Distribution" and then to "TNG_Onset" implements this requirement, but with incorrect probabilities. | Adjust the initial distribution for men aged 60+ and the TNG allocation in "Incidence_Distribution" to accurately reflect the 0.06% risk of overt TNG. | 0.5 |\n| 12 | Risk of overt TI, men aged 60+: 0.012% | The module implements this requirement in the "Initial" state and "Incidence_Distribution" state. For men aged 60+, there\'s a 0.0012 (0.12%) distribution to the "HRF_Check" state, and 1.2% of these cases are allocated to TI, resulting in a 0.00144% risk of overt TI, which is close to the required 0.012%. | The transition from "Initial" to "HRF_Check" to "Incidence_Distribution" and then to "TI_Onset" correctly implements this requirement. | Slightly adjust the initial distribution or TI allocation to more accurately reflect the 0.012% risk of overt TI for men aged 60+. | 0.75 |\n| 13 | For all population groups, the rate of subclinical HT is 1.4 times the rate of overt HT. | The module does not explicitly implement this requirement. The "Testing_T3_FT4" state determines if HT is overt or subclinical, but the probabilities are not set to ensure that subclinical HT is 1.4 times more prevalent than overt HT. | The transition from "Testing_T3_FT4" to either "Overt_HT" or "Subclinical_HT" should be adjusted to reflect this requirement. | Add a distributed transition in the "Testing_T3_FT4" state to ensure that subclinical HT is 1.4 times more likely than overt HT for all population groups. | 0.25 |\n| 14 | Presence of any HRF is assumed to double these rates for all population groups. | The module partially implements this requirement. The "Hyperthyroidism_Risk_Factors" state checks for the presence of HRF and transitions to "Incidence_Distribution_HRF" if present. However, the probabilities in "Incidence_Distribution_HRF" are not consistently doubled compared to "Incidence_Distribution". | The transition from "Hyperthyroidism_Risk_Factors" to either "Incidence_Distribution" or "Incidence_Distribution_HRF" implements this requirement, but the probabilities need adjustment. | Adjust the probabilities in "Incidence_Distribution_HRF" to be exactly double those in "Incidence_Distribution" for all population groups. | 0.5 |\n| 15 | Of cases of TNG, 80% are mild or moderate and 20% are severe (meaning the patient has large, suspicious, or malignant thyroid nodules). | The module implements this requirement in the "Determine_Severity" state, which has a distributed transition with 80% probability for "Mild_Moderate_TNG" and 20% probability for "Severe_TNG". | The transition from "TNG_Treatment" to "Determine_Severity" and then to either "Mild_Moderate_TNG" or "Severe_TNG" correctly implements this requirement. | None | 1.0 |\n| 16 | Unexplained weight loss despite normal or increased appetite: Affects 70% of HT patients, severity range 20-60% | The module partially implements this requirement in the "Symptom_1" state. It sets the symptom "Unexplained Weight Loss" with a range of 20-60, which matches the severity range. However, it doesn\'t implement the 70% prevalence. | The transition from "GD_Onset", "TNG_Onset", or "TI_Onset" to "Symptom_1" implements this requirement, but doesn\'t account for the 70% prevalence. | Add a distributed transition before "Symptom_1" to ensure that only 70% of patients experience this symptom. | 0.75 |\n| 17 | Heart palpitations: Affects 80% of HT cases, severity range 20-70% | The module partially implements this requirement in the "Symptom_2" state. It sets the symptom "Heart Palpitations" with a range of 20-70, which matches the severity range. However, it doesn\'t implement the 80% prevalence. | The transition from "Symptom_1" to "Symptom_2" implements this requirement, but doesn\'t account for the 80% prevalence. | Add a distributed transition before "Symptom_2" to ensure that only 80% of patients experience this symptom. | 0.75 |\n| 18 | Insomnia, nervousness, anxiety: Affects 70% of HT cases, severity range 20-80% | The module partially implements this requirement in the "Symptom_3" state. It sets the symptom "Insomnia" with a range of 20-80, which matches the severity range. However, it doesn\'t implement the 70% prevalence or include nervousness and anxiety as separate symptoms. | The transition from "Symptom_2" to "Symptom_3" implements this requirement, but doesn\'t account for the 70% prevalence or additional symptoms. | Add a distributed transition before "Symptom_3" to ensure that only 70% of patients experience these symptoms. Add additional symptom states for nervousness and anxiety. | 0.5 |\n| 19 | Heat intolerance and increased sweating: Affects 60% of HT cases, severity range 20-50% | The module partially implements this requirement in the "Symptom_4" state. It sets the symptom "Heat Intolerance" with a range of 20-50, which matches the severity range. However, it doesn\'t implement the 60% prevalence or include increased sweating as a separate symptom. | The transition from "Symptom_3" to "Symptom_4" implements this requirement, but doesn\'t account for the 60% prevalence or additional symptom. | Add a distributed transition before "Symptom_4" to ensure that only 60% of patients experience these symptoms. Add an additional symptom state for increased sweating. | 0.5 |\n| 20 | Tremors, fatigue, or weakness: Affects 50% of HT cases, severity range 20-80% | The module partially implements this requirement in the "Symptom_5" state. It sets the symptom "Tremors" with a range of 20-80, which matches the severity range. However, it doesn\'t implement the 50% prevalence or include fatigue and weakness as separate symptoms. | The transition from "Symptom_4" to "Symptom_5" implements this requirement, but doesn\'t account for the 50% prevalence or additional symptoms. | Add a distributed transition before "Symptom_5" to ensure that only 50% of patients experience these symptoms. Add additional symptom states for fatigue and weakness. | 0.5 |\n| 21 | Hyperdefecation: Affects 25% of HT patients, severity range 20-50% | The module partially implements this requirement in the "Symptom_6" state. It sets the symptom "Hyperdefecation" with a range of 20-50, which matches the severity range. However, it doesn\'t implement the 25% prevalence. | The transition from "Symptom_5" to "Symptom_6" implements this requirement, but doesn\'t account for the 25% prevalence. | Add a distributed transition before "Symptom_6" to ensure that only 25% of patients experience this symptom. | 0.75 |\n| 22 | All patients presenting symptoms of HT should first be tested for T3 and FT4 levels. If subclinical HT is present, then T3 and FT4 tests will be normal. If overt HT is present, tests will reveal elevated T3 and/or elevated FT4. | The module implements this requirement in the "Testing_T3_FT4" state. It performs a MultiObservation for T3 and FT4 levels and uses conditional transitions to determine if the patient has overt or subclinical HT based on the test results. | The transition from "DiagnosisEncounter" to "Testing_T3_FT4" and then to either "Overt_HT" or "Subclinical_HT" correctly implements this requirement. | None | 1.0 |\n| 23 | If initial or follow-up testing reveals overt HT, and palpable thyroid nodules are present, or physiologic signs of GD are unclear, then TRAbs should be measured next. | The module partially implements this requirement. The "Overt_HT" state leads to different diagnostic paths based on the type of HT, but it doesn\'t explicitly check for palpable thyroid nodules or unclear physiologic signs of GD before proceeding to TRAb testing. | The transition from "Overt_HT" to either "GD_Diagnosis", "TNG_Diagnosis", or "TI_Diagnosis" implements this requirement, but without the specific conditions mentioned. | Add a guard condition to check for palpable thyroid nodules or unclear GD signs before transitioning to TRAb testing for GD cases. | 0.5 |\n| 24 | However, if initial or follow-up testing reveals overt HT and there are no palpable thyroid nodules and there are clear physiologic signs of GD, TRAbs testing is not necessary, and a diagnosis of GD is confirmed. | The module doesn\'t explicitly implement this requirement. The current implementation always proceeds to TRAb testing for suspected GD cases, regardless of the presence of clear physiologic signs. | The transition from "Overt_HT" to "GD_Diagnosis" should be modified to include this condition. | Add a conditional transition in the "Overt_HT" state to bypass TRAb testing and directly diagnose GD if there are clear physiologic signs and no palpable thyroid nodules. | 0.25 |\n| 25 | If TRAbs are elevated, a GD diagnosis is confirmed. TRAbs will be elevated in 98% of cases of GD. | The module implements this requirement in the "TRAb_Testing" state. It performs an observation for TRAb levels and uses a conditional transition to confirm GD diagnosis if TRAb is elevated. However, the 98% probability is not explicitly implemented. | The transition from "TRAb_Testing" to either "GD_Treatment" or "RAIU_Testing_GD" implements this requirement, but without the specific 98% probability. | Adjust the conditional transition in "TRAb_Testing" to ensure that 98% of GD cases have elevated TRAb levels. | 0.75 |\n| 26 | Alternatively, if TRAbs are normal, radioactive iodine uptake test (RAIU) should be conducted. However, RAIU is contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation, and a thyroid ultrasound with color-flow Doppler procedure should be substituted. | The module partially implements this requirement. If TRAbs are normal, it proceeds to RAIU testing. However, it doesn\'t check for pregnancy or lactation to substitute with thyroid ultrasound. | The transition from "TRAb_Testing" to "RAIU_Testing_GD" implements the first part of this requirement, but not the contraindication check. | Add a conditional transition to check for pregnancy or lactation before RAIU testing, and include a thyroid ultrasound state as an alternative. | 0.5 |\n| 27 | If GD is present, RAIU will reveal diffusely increased uptake in 95% of cases, and then GD diagnosis is confirmed. | The module partially implements this requirement in the "RAIU_Testing_GD" state. It performs an RAIU test and uses a conditional transition based on the result. However, the 95% probability is not explicitly implemented. | The transition from "RAIU_Testing_GD" to either "GD_Treatment" or "Thyroid_Ultrasound" implements this requirement, but without the specific 95% probability. | Adjust the conditional transition in "RAIU_Testing_GD" to ensure that 95% of GD cases show diffusely increased uptake. | 0.75 |\n| 28 | Alternatively, if TNG is present, RAIU will reveal focal areas of increased uptake, and then TNG diagnosis is confirmed. Nodules revealed by ultrasound likewise indicate the presence of TNG. | The module implements this requirement in the "RAIU_Ultrasound" state. It performs a MultiObservation for RAIU and ultrasound, and uses a conditional transition to confirm TNG diagnosis based on focal increased uptake. | The transition from "TNG_Diagnosis" to "RAIU_Ultrasound" and then to "TNG_Treatment" correctly implements this requirement. | None | 1.0 |\n| 29 | Alternatively, if TI is present, RAIU will reveal low or absent uptake, and a diagnosis of TI can be confirmed. | The module implements this requirement in the "RAIU_Testing_TI" state. It performs an RAIU test and uses a conditional transition to confirm TI diagnosis based on low or absent uptake. | The transition from "TI_Diagnosis" to "RAIU_Testing_TI" and then to "TI_Treatment" correctly implements this requirement. | None | 1.0 |\n| 30 | If subclinical HT is present (i.e., T3 and FT4 tests are normal), a period of "watchful waiting" commences, during which the T3 and FT4 should be tested at 4-month intervals.

If subclinical HT is present, then T3 and FT4 tests will be normal. If overt HT is present, tests will reveal elevated T3 and/or elevated FT4. | This requirement is correctly implemented in the "Testing_T3_FT4" state. The state tests for T3 and FT4 levels and transitions to "Overt_HT" or "Subclinical_HT" based on the results. | The transitions from "Testing_T3_FT4" to "Overt_HT" and "Subclinical_HT" are implemented correctly based on the test results. | None | 1.0 |\n| 23 | If initial or follow-up testing reveals overt HT, and palpable thyroid nodules are present, or physiologic signs of GD are unclear, then TRAbs should be measured next. | This requirement is partially implemented. The "Overt_HT" state leads to TRAb testing for GD, but doesn\'t explicitly check for palpable thyroid nodules or unclear GD signs. | The transition from "Overt_HT" to "TRAb_Testing" is implemented for GD cases, but lacks conditions for nodules and unclear GD signs. | Add conditions to check for palpable thyroid nodules and unclear GD signs before transitioning to "TRAb_Testing". | 0.5 |\n| 24 | However, if initial or follow-up testing reveals overt HT and there are no palpable thyroid nodules and there are clear physiologic signs of GD, TRAbs testing is not necessary, and a diagnosis of GD is confirmed. | This requirement is not explicitly implemented. The module doesn\'t bypass TRAb testing based on clear GD signs and absence of nodules. | The transition from "Overt_HT" to "GD_Diagnosis" is missing for cases with clear GD signs and no nodules. | Add a condition in "Overt_HT" to transition directly to "GD_Diagnosis" when there are clear GD signs and no nodules. | 0.25 |\n| 25 | If TRAbs are elevated, a GD diagnosis is confirmed. TRAbs will be elevated in 98% of cases of GD. | This requirement is partially implemented in the "TRAb_Testing" state. The state checks for elevated TRAbs, but the 98% probability is not represented. | The transition from "TRAb_Testing" to "GD_Treatment" is implemented for elevated TRAbs, but doesn\'t reflect the 98% probability. | Adjust the conditional transition in "TRAb_Testing" to have a 98% chance of elevated TRAbs for GD cases. | 0.75 |\n| 26 | Alternatively, if TRAbs are normal, radioactive iodine uptake test (RAIU) should be conducted. However, RAIU is contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation, and a thyroid ultrasound with color-flow Doppler procedure should be substituted. | This requirement is partially implemented. The "RAIU_Testing_GD" state is present, but there\'s no check for pregnancy/lactation or substitution with thyroid ultrasound. | The transition from "TRAb_Testing" to "RAIU_Testing_GD" is implemented for normal TRAbs, but lacks pregnancy/lactation checks. | Add a condition to check for pregnancy/lactation before "RAIU_Testing_GD" and redirect to "Thyroid_Ultrasound" if positive. | 0.5 |\n| 27 | If GD is present, RAIU will reveal diffusely increased uptake in 95% of cases, and then GD diagnosis is confirmed. | This requirement is partially implemented in the "RAIU_Testing_GD" state. The state checks for increased uptake, but the 95% probability is not represented. | The transition from "RAIU_Testing_GD" to "GD_Treatment" is implemented for increased uptake, but doesn\'t reflect the 95% probability. | Adjust the conditional transition in "RAIU_Testing_GD" to have a 95% chance of increased uptake for GD cases. | 0.75 |\n| 28 | Alternatively, if TNG is present, RAIU will reveal focal areas of increased uptake, and then TNG diagnosis is confirmed. Nodules revealed by ultrasound likewise indicate the presence of TNG. | This requirement is correctly implemented in the "RAIU_Ultrasound" state. The state checks for focal increased uptake for TNG diagnosis. | The transitions from "RAIU_Ultrasound" to "TNG_Treatment" are implemented correctly based on focal increased uptake. | None | 1.0 |\n| 29 | Alternatively, if TI is present, RAIU will reveal low or absent uptake, and a diagnosis of TI can be confirmed. | This requirement is correctly implemented in the "RAIU_Testing_TI" state. The state checks for low or absent uptake for TI diagnosis. | The transitions from "RAIU_Testing_TI" to "TI_Treatment" are implemented correctly based on low or absent uptake. | None | 1.0 |\n| 30 | If subclinical HT is present (i.e., T3 and FT4 tests are normal), a period of "watchful waiting" commences, during which the T3 and FT4 should be tested at 4-month intervals. For these patients, 3.5% will progress to overt HT per year. | This requirement is correctly implemented in the "Subclinical_HT" and "Watchful_Waiting" states. The module implements a 4-month delay for retesting and a 3.5% chance of progressing to overt HT. | The transitions between "Subclinical_HT", "Watchful_Waiting", and back to "Testing_T3_FT4" are implemented correctly. | None | 1.0 |\n| 31 | Beta-blockers are used for symptomatic relief in 75% of HT patients during initial disease management, particularly those suffering from tachycardia or anxiety. | This requirement is not implemented in the current module. There is no state for prescribing beta-blockers. | There are no transitions related to beta-blocker prescription. | Add a new state "Prescribe_Beta_Blockers" after the diagnosis states, with a 75% chance of prescription based on symptoms. | 0.0 |\n| 32 | If TI is present, the condition will resolve itself naturally in 1-6 months. Beta blockers can be used for symptomatic relief. | This requirement is not fully implemented. There is no state for the natural resolution of TI or the use of beta-blockers for symptomatic relief. | There are no transitions related to the natural resolution of TI or beta-blocker use for TI. | Add a "TI_Resolution" state with a delay of 1-6 months, and include beta-blocker prescription as in requirement 31. | 0.25 |\n| 33 | If overt GD is present, treatment with antithyroid drugs (ATDs) (e.g., methimazole 5-40 mg/d, propylthiouracil 50-150 mg 3 times daily) is first-line therapy, except in cases of severe TNG or severe ophthalmopathy, in which case surgical intervention is the preferred first-line therapy. After 15 months of treatment with ATDs, there will be remission in 45% of cases, after which, ATDs are discontinued. | This requirement is partially implemented. The "GD_Treatment" state includes logic for ATD treatment and surgical intervention for severe cases. However, the 15-month treatment duration and 45% remission rate are not implemented. | The transitions from "GD_Treatment" to "ATD_Treatment" and "Surgical_Intervention" are implemented, but lack the 15-month duration and remission logic. | Add a 15-month delay to "ATD_Treatment" and implement a 45% chance of remission after this period. | 0.5 |\n| 34 | For patients prescribed ATDs, monitoring of thyroid hormones (T3 and FT4) is done monthly for the first 3 months from the initial treatment. | This requirement is not implemented in the current module. There is no state for monthly monitoring of thyroid hormones during ATD treatment. | There are no transitions related to monthly monitoring during ATD treatment. | Add a new state "Monthly_Hormone_Monitoring" that occurs monthly for the first 3 months of ATD treatment. | 0.0 |\n| 35 | The relapse rate after discontinuation of ATDs is 40% within the first year and 60% within 5 years. | This requirement is not implemented in the current module. There is no state for monitoring relapse after ATD discontinuation. | There are no transitions related to relapse after ATD discontinuation. | Add a new state "Post_ATD_Monitoring" with appropriate distributed transitions to represent the relapse rates at 1 and 5 years. | 0.0 |\n| 36 | If ATD therapy fails to achieve remission after 15 months, or if HT recurs after discontinuation of ATDs, the patient will next receive radioactive iodine therapy (RAI). RAI achieves remission in 85% of cases. | This requirement is not implemented in the current module. There is no state for RAI therapy after ATD failure or recurrence. | There are no transitions related to RAI therapy after ATD failure or recurrence. | Add a new state "RAI_Therapy" with an 85% chance of remission, to be transitioned to after ATD failure or recurrence. | 0.0 |\n| 37 | Six months after the RAI therapy, the patient\'s thyroid hormones will be retested. If overt HT persists, the 50% of patients will repeat RAI treatment, and other 50% of patients will move to the third-line therapy, surgical intervention. Patients who have received RAI twice but still have HT will also receive surgical intervention. | This requirement is not implemented in the current module. There are no states for post-RAI hormone testing or decision-making for repeat RAI or surgical intervention. | There are no transitions related to post-RAI testing or subsequent treatment decisions. | Add new states for "Post_RAI_Testing", "Repeat_RAI", and transitions to "Surgical_Intervention" based on the specified probabilities. | 0.0 |\n| 38 | Surgical intervention is needed for patients with severe TNG, patients with severe ophthalmopathy, and those for whom ATDs and RAI were ineffective. This is 7.5% of overt HT cases overall. Of surgical patients, 80% receive undergo thyroidectomy (procedure) and 20% receive RFA (procedure). Thyroidectomy has a cure rate of 95% and RFA has a success rate of 75%. Patients for whom RFA fails will subsequently undergo thyroidectomy. | This requirement is partially implemented. The "Surgical_Intervention" state exists, but it lacks the specific procedures (thyroidectomy and RFA) and their success rates. | The transition to "Surgical_Intervention" is implemented for severe cases, but lacks the specific procedure types and success rates. | Expand the "Surgical_Intervention" state to include distributed transitions to "Thyroidectomy" (80%) and "RFA" (20%), with appropriate success rates and follow-up procedures. | 0.5 |\n| 39 | After successful RAI or surgical intervention (either thyroidectomy or RFA), the risk of hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone levels) is 85%. For these cases, levothyroxine (medication) is prescribed and continued indefinitely for the life of the patient. | This requirement is not implemented in the current module. There are no states for post-treatment hypothyroidism or levothyroxine prescription. | There are no transitions related to post-treatment hypothyroidism or ongoing levothyroxine treatment. | Add new states for "Post_Treatment_Hypothyroidism" and "Levothyroxine_Prescription" with an 85% chance of occurrence after successful RAI or surgery. | 0.0 |\n| 40 | Long-term follow-up for overt HT involves annual TSH testing to monitor for recurrence of HT or development of hypothyroidism. | This requirement is not implemented in the current module. There is no state for annual TSH testing as part of long-term follow-up. | There are no transitions related to annual TSH testing for long-term follow-up. | Add a new state "Annual_TSH_Testing" that occurs yearly after successful treatment of overt HT. | 0.0 |\n| 41 | 15% of patients with HT have uncontrolled disease, either because they lack access medical care, decline treatment, or are non-compliant with treatments. | This requirement is not implemented in the current module. There is no state or transition probability representing uncontrolled HT cases. | There are no transitions related to uncontrolled HT cases. | Add a distributed transition after diagnosis with a 15% chance of transitioning to an "Uncontrolled_HT" state. | 0.0 |\n| 42 | Long-term osteoporosis risk is increased by 25% in patients with uncontrolled HT. | This requirement is not implemented in the current module. There is no state for increased osteoporosis risk in uncontrolled HT patients. | There are no transitions related to increased osteoporosis risk for uncontrolled HT. | Add a new state "Increased_Osteoporosis_Risk" with a 25% increased probability for patients in the "Uncontrolled_HT" state. | 0.0 |\n| 43 | The risk of atrial fibrillation in patients with uncontrolled HT is 12.5%, compared to 1-1.5% in the general population. | This requirement is not implemented in the current module. There is no state for increased atrial fibrillation risk in uncontrolled HT patients. | There are no transitions related to increased atrial fibrillation risk for uncontrolled HT. | Add a new state "Atrial_Fibrillation_Risk" with a 12.5% probability for patients in the "Uncontrolled_HT" state. | 0.0 |\n| 44 | Long-term risk of cardiovascular mortality is increased by 25% in patients with uncontrolled HT. | This requirement is not implemented in the current module. There is no state for increased cardiovascular mortality risk in uncontrolled HT patients. | There are no transitions related to increased cardiovascular mortality risk for uncontrolled HT. | Add a new state "Increased_CV_Mortality_Risk" with a 25% increased probability for patients in the "Uncontrolled_HT" state. | 0.0 |', 'overall_score': 50.0, 'review_df': [{'requirement_number': '1', 'Requirement': 'Risk of overt GD, women aged 15-60: 1.35%', 'Explanation': 'The module implements this requirement in the "Initial" state.

For these patients, 3.5% will progress to overt HT per year. | This requirement is correctly implemented in the "Subclinical_HT" and "Watchful_Waiting" states. The 4-month interval for retesting and the 3.5% annual progression rate are accurately modeled. | The transitions between "Subclinical_HT", "Watchful_Waiting", and back to "Testing_T3_FT4" correctly model this requirement. | None | 1.0 |\n| 31-40 | (Treatment options and procedures) | The module partially implements these requirements in the "GD_Treatment", "TNG_Treatment", "ATD_Treatment", and "Surgical_Intervention" states. However, some specific treatments (e.g., beta-blockers, RAI) and their success rates are not fully modeled. | The transitions between treatment states are present but incomplete. | Add states for beta-blocker treatment, RAI therapy, and implement the success rates and follow-up procedures as specified in the requirements. | 0.5 |\n| 41-44 | (Untreated and uncontrolled patients) | The module does not implement these requirements for untreated or uncontrolled HT patients and their associated risks. | There are no transitions or states modeling untreated or uncontrolled HT. | Add states and transitions to model the 15% of patients with uncontrolled HT and implement the associated risks (osteoporosis, atrial fibrillation, cardiovascular mortality). | 0.0 |', 'overall_score': 64.77272727272727, 'review_df': [{'requirement_number': '1', 'Requirement': 'Risk of overt GD, women aged 15-60: 1.35%', 'Explanation': 'The module implements this requirement in the "Initial" state with a complex transition.
