However, the severity distinction between mild/moderate and severe is not implemented. | The transition from "HT_Symptom_Ophthalmopathy" to "Ophthalmopathy_Symptom" has a 33% probability for Graves\' Disease patients, and the symptom severity range is set to 20-80. | Add logic to distinguish between mild/moderate (20-79%) and severe (80-100%) ophthalmopathy. | 0.75 |\n| 23 | All patients presenting symptoms of HT should first be tested for T3 and FT4 levels. If subclinical HT is present, then T3 and FT4 tests will be normal. If overt HT is present, tests will reveal elevated T3 and/or elevated FT4. | This requirement is accurately implemented in the "T3_FT4_Test" state and its transitions. | The "T3_FT4_Test" state leads to either "Elevated_T3_FT4" or "Normal_T3_FT4" based on the type of HT. | None | 1.0 |\n| 24 | If initial or follow-up testing reveals overt HT, and palpable thyroid nodules are present, or physiologic signs of GD are unclear, then TRAbs should be measured next. | This requirement is partially implemented in the "Check_Clear_GD" and "Check_Palpable_Thyroid" states. However, the check for unclear physiologic signs of GD is not explicitly implemented. | The transitions from "Check_Clear_GD" and "Check_Palpable_Thyroid" lead to either "Confirm_GD" or "TRAbs_Test" based on the conditions. | Add a check for unclear physiologic signs of GD in addition to the palpable thyroid check. | 0.75 |\n| 25 | However, if initial or follow-up testing reveals overt HT and there are no palpable thyroid nodules and there are clear physiologic signs of GD, TRAbs testing is not necessary, and a diagnosis of GD is confirmed. | This requirement is partially implemented in the "Check_Clear_GD" state. However, the check for clear physiologic signs of GD is not explicitly implemented. | The transition from "Check_Clear_GD" to "Confirm_GD" occurs when ophthalmopathy is present, which is used as a proxy for clear GD signs. | Add a more comprehensive check for clear physiologic signs of GD beyond just ophthalmopathy. | 0.75 |\n| 26 | If TRAbs are elevated, a GD diagnosis is confirmed. TRAbs will be elevated in 98% of cases of GD. | This requirement is accurately implemented in the "TRAbs_Test" state and its transitions. | The transition from "TRAbs_Test" to "Elevated_TRAbs" has a 98% probability for Graves\' Disease patients. | None | 1.0 |\n| 27 | Alternatively, if TRAbs are normal, radioactive iodine uptake test (RAIU) should be conducted. However, RAIU is contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation, and a thyroid ultrasound with color-flow Doppler procedure should be substituted. | This requirement is accurately implemented in the "Normal_TRAbs", "Check_RAIU_Contraindications", and "Thyroid_Ultrasound" states. | The transitions from "Normal_TRAbs" lead to either "RAIU_Test" or "Thyroid_Ultrasound" based on pregnancy or lactation status. | None | 1.0 |\n| 28 | If GD is present, RAIU will reveal diffusely increased uptake in 95% of cases, and then GD diagnosis is confirmed. | This requirement is accurately implemented in the "RAIU_Test" and "Diffuse_RAIU" states. | The transition from "RAIU_Test" to "Diffuse_RAIU" has a 95% probability for Graves\' Disease patients. | None | 1.0 |\n| 29 | Alternatively, if TNG is present, RAIU will reveal focal areas of increased uptake, and then TNG diagnosis is confirmed. Nodules revealed by ultrasound likewise indicate the presence of TNG. | This requirement is accurately implemented in the "RAIU_Test", "Focal_RAIU", and "Thyroid_Ultrasound" states. | The transitions from "RAIU_Test" to "Focal_RAIU" and from "Thyroid_Ultrasound" to "Determine_Treatment" handle the TNG diagnosis confirmation. | None | 1.0 |\n| 30 | Alternatively, if TI is present, RAIU will reveal low or absent uptake, and a diagnosis of TI can be confirmed. | This requirement is accurately implemented in the "RAIU_Test" and "Low_RAIU" states. | The transition from "RAIU_Test" to "Low_RAIU" occurs for Thyroiditis patients. | None | 1.0 |\n| 31 | If subclinical HT is present (i.e., T3 and FT4 tests are normal), a period of "watchful waiting" commences, during which the T3 and FT4 should be tested at 4-month intervals. For these patients, 3.5% will progress to overt HT per year. | This requirement is partially implemented in the "Watchful_Waiting", "Subclinical_Follow_Up", and "Subclinical_T3_FT4_Test" states. However, the progression rate to overt HT is not accurately reflected. | The transition from "Subclinical_T3_FT4_Test" to "Progress_To_Overt_HT" has a 3.5% probability, but this is per 4-month interval, not per year as specified. | Adjust the progression probability to reflect a 3.5% annual rate, which would be approximately 1.17% per 4-month interval. | 0.75 |\n| 32 | Beta-blockers are used for symptomatic relief in 75% of HT patients during initial disease management, particularly those suffering from tachycardia or anxiety. | This requirement is accurately implemented in the "Consider_Beta_Blockers" and "Check_Beta_Blocker_Symptoms" states. | The transition from "Consider_Beta_Blockers" to "Check_Beta_Blocker_Symptoms" has a 75% probability, and the symptoms are checked before prescribing. | None | 1.0 |\n| 33 | If TI is present, the condition will resolve itself naturally in 1-6 months. Beta blockers can be used for symptomatic relief. | This requirement is accurately implemented in the "Monitor_TI" and "Resolved_TI" states. | The transition from "Monitor_TI" to "Resolved_TI" occurs after a 1-6 month delay. Beta blockers can be prescribed in the "Consider_Beta_Blockers" state. | None | 1.0 |\n| 34 | If overt GD is present, treatment with antithyroid drugs (ATDs) (e.g., methimazole 5-40 mg/d, propylthiouracil 50-150 mg 3 times daily) is first-line therapy, except in cases of severe TNG or severe ophthalmopathy, in which case surgical intervention is the preferred first-line therapy. After 15 months of treatment with ATDs, there will be remission in 45% of cases, after which, ATDs are discontinued. | This requirement is partially implemented in the "Prescribe_ATDs", "ATD_Treatment", and "Evaluate_ATD_Response" states. However, the exception for severe TNG or severe ophthalmopathy is not implemented. | The transitions from "Prescribe_ATDs" through "Evaluate_ATD_Response" model the ATD treatment and remission probability. | Add a check for severe TNG or severe ophthalmopathy before prescribing ATDs, and route these cases directly to surgical intervention. | 0.75 |\n| 35 | For patients prescribed ATDs, monitoring of thyroid hormones (T3 and FT4) is done monthly for the first 3 months from the initial treatment. | This requirement is accurately implemented in the "Monthly_Thyroid_Test" state. | The "Monthly_Thyroid_Test" state occurs after ATD prescription and lasts for 3 months. | None | 1.0 |\n| 36 | The relapse rate after discontinuation of ATDs is 40% within the first year and 60% within 5 years. | This requirement is partially implemented in the "ATD_Relapse_Check" state. However, the relapse rates are not accurately reflected over time. | The transitions from "ATD_Relapse_Check" model decreasing relapse probabilities over time, but not exactly as specified. | Adjust the relapse probabilities in "ATD_Relapse_Check" to more accurately reflect the specified rates over time. | 0.75 |\n| 37 | If ATD therapy fails to achieve remission after 15 months, or if HT recurs after discontinuation of ATDs, the patient will next receive radioactive iodine therapy (RAI). RAI achieves remission in 85% of cases. | This requirement is accurately implemented in the "Evaluate_ATD_Response", "RAI_Therapy", and "Evaluate_RAI_Response" states. | The transitions from "Evaluate_ATD_Response" to "RAI_Therapy" and then to "Evaluate_RAI_Response" model this treatment path with the correct remission rate. | None | 1.0 |\n| 38 | Six months after the RAI therapy, the patient\'s thyroid hormones will be retested. If overt HT persists, the 50% of patients will repeat RAI treatment, and other 50% of patients will move to the third-line therapy, surgical intervention. Patients who have received RAI twice but still have HT will also receive surgical intervention. | This requirement is accurately implemented in the "RAI_Follow_Up" and "Evaluate_RAI_Response" states. | The transitions from "RAI_Follow_Up" to "Evaluate_RAI_Response" and then to either "Repeat_RAI" or "Surgical_Intervention" model this treatment path with the correct probabilities. | None | 1.0 |\n| 39 | Surgical intervention is needed for patients with severe TNG, patients with severe ophthalmopathy, and those for whom ATDs and RAI were ineffective. This is 7.5% of overt HT cases overall. Of surgical patients, 80% receive undergo thyroidectomy (procedure) and 20% receive RFA (procedure). Thyroidectomy has a cure rate of 95% and RFA has a success rate of 75%. Patients for whom RFA fails will subsequently undergo thyroidectomy. | This requirement is accurately implemented in the "Surgical_Intervention", "Thyroidectomy", "RFA", and related states. | The transitions from "Surgical_Intervention" to either "Thyroidectomy" or "RFA", and the subsequent success/failure transitions, model this treatment path with the correct probabilities. | None | 1.0 |\n| 40 | After successful RAI or surgical intervention (either thyroidectomy or RFA), the risk of hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone levels) is 85%. For these cases, levothyroxine (medication) is prescribed and continued indefinitely for the life of the patient. | This requirement is accurately implemented in the "Check_Hypothyroidism", "Develop_Hypothyroidism", and "Prescribe_Levothyroxine" states. | The transition from "Check_Hypothyroidism" to "Develop_Hypothyroidism" has an 85% probability, followed by levothyroxine prescription. | None | 1.0 |\n| 41 | Long-term follow-up for overt HT involves annual TSH testing to monitor for recurrence of HT or development of hypothyroidism. | This requirement is accurately implemented in the "Long_Term_Follow_Up" and "Annual_TSH_Test" states. | The transitions to and from "Long_Term_Follow_Up" and "Annual_TSH_Test" model the annual follow-up process. | None | 1.0 |\n| 42 | 15% of patients with HT have uncontrolled disease, either because they lack access medical care, decline treatment, or are non-compliant with treatments. | This requirement is accurately implemented in the "Determine_Treatment" state. | The transition from "Determine_Treatment" to "Uncontrolled_HT" has a 15% probability. | None | 1.0 |\n| 43 | Long-term osteoporosis risk is increased by 25% in patients with uncontrolled HT. | This requirement is partially implemented in the "Long_Term_Complications" and "Increased_Osteoporosis_Risk" states. However, the 25% increased risk is not accurately reflected. | The transition from "Long_Term_Complications" to "Increased_Osteoporosis_Risk" has a 25% probability, which doesn\'t accurately model a 25% increased risk. | Adjust the logic to more accurately reflect a 25% increased risk of osteoporosis for uncontrolled HT patients. | 0.75 |\n| 44 | The risk of atrial fibrillation in patients with uncontrolled HT is 12.5%, compared to 1-1.5% in the general population. | This requirement is partially implemented in the "Long_Term_Complications" and "Increased_Atrial_Fibrillation_Risk" states. However, the 12.5% risk is not accurately reflected. | The transition from "Long_Term_Complications" to "Increased_Atrial_Fibrillation_Risk" has a 15% probability, which is higher than the specified 12.5%. | Adjust the transition probability to "Increased_Atrial_Fibrillation_Risk" to 12.5%. | 0.75 |\n| 45 | Long-term risk of cardiovascular mortality is increased by 25% in patients with uncontrolled HT. | This requirement is partially implemented in the "Long_Term_Complications" and "Increased_Cardiovascular_Mortality_Risk" states. However, the 25% increased risk is not accurately reflected. | The transition from "Long_Term_Complications" to "Increased_Cardiovascular_Mortality_Risk" has a 5% probability, which doesn\'t accurately model a 25% increased risk. | Adjust the logic to more accurately reflect a 25% increased risk of cardiovascular mortality for uncontrolled HT patients. | 0.75 |', 'overall_score': 87.22222222222223, 'review_df': [{'requirement_number': '1', 'Requirement': 'Risk of overt GD, women aged 15-60: 1.35%', 'Explanation': 'This requirement is implemented in the "Determine_HT_Type" state.

If subclinical HT is present, then T3 and FT4 tests will be normal. If overt HT is present, tests will reveal elevated T3 and/or elevated FT4. | The module implements this in the "T3_FT4_Test", "Elevated_T3_FT4", and "Normal_T3_FT4" states. | The transitions from "T3_FT4_Test" to "Elevated_T3_FT4" or "Normal_T3_FT4" implement this requirement correctly. | None | 1.0 |\n| 24 | If initial or follow-up testing reveals overt HT, and palpable thyroid nodules are present, or physiologic signs of GD are unclear, then TRAbs should be measured next. | The module implements this in the "Check_Clear_GD" and "Check_Palpable_Thyroid" states. | The transitions from "Check_Clear_GD" to "Check_Palpable_Thyroid" and then to "TRAbs_Test" implement this requirement correctly. | None | 1.0 |\n| 25 | However, if initial or follow-up testing reveals overt HT and there are no palpable thyroid nodules and there are clear physiologic signs of GD, TRAbs testing is not necessary, and a diagnosis of GD is confirmed. | The module implements this in the "Check_Clear_GD" state. | The transition from "Check_Clear_GD" directly to "Confirm_GD" implements this requirement correctly. | None | 1.0 |\n| 26 | If TRAbs are elevated, a GD diagnosis is confirmed. TRAbs will be elevated in 98% of cases of GD. | The module implements this in the "TRAbs_Test" and "Elevated_TRAbs" states with the correct 98% probability. | The transition from "TRAbs_Test" to "Elevated_TRAbs" reflects the 98% probability correctly. | None | 1.0 |\n| 27 | Alternatively, if TRAbs are normal, radioactive iodine uptake test (RAIU) should be conducted. However, RAIU is contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation, and a thyroid ultrasound with color-flow Doppler procedure should be substituted. | The module implements this in the "Normal_TRAbs", "Check_RAIU_Contraindications", "RAIU_Test", and "Thyroid_Ultrasound" states. | The transitions between these states implement this requirement correctly, including the contraindication check. | None | 1.0 |\n| 28 | If GD is present, RAIU will reveal diffusely increased uptake in 95% of cases, and then GD diagnosis is confirmed. | The module implements this in the "RAIU_Test" and "Diffuse_RAIU" states with the correct 95% probability. | The transition from "RAIU_Test" to "Diffuse_RAIU" reflects the 95% probability correctly. | None | 1.0 |\n| 29 | Alternatively, if TNG is present, RAIU will reveal focal areas of increased uptake, and then TNG diagnosis is confirmed. Nodules revealed by ultrasound likewise indicate the presence of TNG. | The module implements this in the "RAIU_Test", "Focal_RAIU", and "Confirm_TNG" states. | The transitions between these states implement this requirement correctly. | None | 1.0 |\n| 30 | Alternatively, if TI is present, RAIU will reveal low or absent uptake, and a diagnosis of TI can be confirmed. | The module implements this in the "RAIU_Test", "Low_RAIU", and "Confirm_TI" states. | The transitions between these states implement this requirement correctly. | None | 1.0 |\n| 31 | If subclinical HT is present (i.e., T3 and FT4 tests are normal), a period of "watchful waiting" commences, during which the T3 and FT4 should be tested at 4-month intervals. For these patients, 3.5% will progress to overt HT per year. | The module implements this in the "Watchful_Waiting", "Subclinical_Follow_Up", and "Subclinical_T3_FT4_Test" states. However, the progression rate to overt HT is not accurately represented. | The transitions between these states implement the watchful waiting period correctly, but the progression rate needs adjustment. | Adjust the distribution in "Subclinical_T3_FT4_Test" to reflect a 3.5% progression rate to overt HT per year. | 0.75 |\n| 32 | Beta-blockers are used for symptomatic relief in 75% of HT patients during initial disease management, particularly those suffering from tachycardia or anxiety. | The module implements this in the "Consider_Beta_Blockers", "Check_Beta_Blocker_Symptoms", and "Prescribe_Beta_Blockers" states with the correct 75% probability. | The transitions between these states implement this requirement correctly. | None | 1.0 |\n| 33 | If TI is present, the condition will resolve itself naturally in 1-6 months. Beta blockers can be used for symptomatic relief. | The module implements this in the "Monitor_TI" and "Resolved_TI" states. However, the use of beta blockers for symptomatic relief is not explicitly modeled for TI. | The transition from "Monitor_TI" to "Resolved_TI" implements the natural resolution correctly. | Add a state to prescribe beta blockers for symptomatic relief in TI cases. | 0.75 |\n| 34 | If overt GD is present, treatment with antithyroid drugs (ATDs) (e.g., methimazole 5-40 mg/d, propylthiouracil 50-150 mg 3 times daily) is first-line therapy, except in cases of severe TNG or severe ophthalmopathy, in which case surgical intervention is the preferred first-line therapy. After 15 months of treatment with ATDs, there will be remission in 45% of cases, after which, ATDs are discontinued. | The module implements this in the "Prescribe_ATDs", "ATD_Treatment", and "Evaluate_ATD_Response" states. The 15-month treatment period and 45% remission rate are correctly implemented. | The transitions between these states implement this requirement correctly. | None | 1.0 |\n| 35 | For patients prescribed ATDs, monitoring of thyroid hormones (T3 and FT4) is done monthly for the first 3 months from the initial treatment. | The module implements this in the "Monthly_Thyroid_Test" state. | The transition to and from "Monthly_Thyroid_Test" implements this requirement correctly. | None | 1.0 |\n| 36 | The relapse rate after discontinuation of ATDs is 40% within the first year and 60% within 5 years. | The module implements this in the "ATD_Follow_Up" and "ATD_Relapse_Check" states. However, the relapse rates are not accurately represented. | The transitions in "ATD_Relapse_Check" need adjustment to reflect the correct relapse rates. | Adjust the distributions in "ATD_Relapse_Check" to reflect 40% relapse in the first year and 60% within 5 years. | 0.5 |\n| 37 | If ATD therapy fails to achieve remission after 15 months, or if HT recurs after discontinuation of ATDs, the patient will next receive radioactive iodine therapy (RAI). RAI achieves remission in 85% of cases. | The module implements this in the "RAI_Therapy", "RAI_Follow_Up", and "Evaluate_RAI_Response" states with the correct 85% remission rate. | The transitions between these states implement this requirement correctly. | None | 1.0 |\n| 38 | Six months after the RAI therapy, the patient\'s thyroid hormones will be retested. If overt HT persists, the 50% of patients will repeat RAI treatment, and other 50% of patients will move to the third-line therapy, surgical intervention. Patients who have received RAI twice but still have HT will also receive surgical intervention. | The module implements this in the "RAI_Follow_Up" and "Evaluate_RAI_Response" states. However, the option for a second RAI treatment is not explicitly modeled. | The transitions from "Evaluate_RAI_Response" need adjustment to include the possibility of a second RAI treatment. | Add a state for second RAI treatment and adjust the transitions accordingly. | 0.75 |\n| 39 | Surgical intervention is needed for patients with severe TNG, patients with severe ophthalmopathy, and those for whom ATDs and RAI were ineffective. This is 7.5% of overt HT cases overall. Of surgical patients, 80% receive undergo thyroidectomy (procedure) and 20% receive RFA (procedure). Thyroidectomy has a cure rate of 95% and RFA has a success rate of 75%. Patients for whom RFA fails will subsequently undergo thyroidectomy. | The module implements this in the "Surgical_Intervention", "Thyroidectomy", "RFA", "Thyroidectomy_Success", "Thyroidectomy_Failure", "RFA_Success", and "RFA_Failure" states with the correct probabilities. | The transitions between these states implement this requirement correctly. | None | 1.0 |\n| 40 | After successful RAI or surgical intervention (either thyroidectomy or RFA), the risk of hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone levels) is 85%. For these cases, levothyroxine (medication) is prescribed and continued indefinitely for the life of the patient. | The module implements this in the "Check_Hypothyroidism", "Develop_Hypothyroidism", and "Prescribe_Levothyroxine" states with the correct 85% probability. | The transitions between these states implement this requirement correctly. | None | 1.0 |\n| 41 | Long-term follow-up for overt HT involves annual TSH testing to monitor for recurrence of HT or development of hypothyroidism. | The module implements this in the "Long_Term_Follow_Up" and "Annual_TSH_Test" states. | The transitions to and from these states implement this requirement correctly. | None | 1.0 |\n| 42 | 15% of patients with HT have uncontrolled disease, either because they lack access medical care, decline treatment, or are non-compliant with treatments. | The module implements this in the "Determine_Treatment" state with a 15% probability for "Uncontrolled_HT". | The transition from "Determine_Treatment" to "Uncontrolled_HT" reflects the 15% probability correctly. | None | 1.0 |\n| 43 | Long-term osteoporosis risk is increased by 25% in patients with uncontrolled HT. | The module implements this in the "Long_Term_Complications" and "Increased_Osteoporosis_Risk" states. However, the 25% increased risk is not explicitly modeled. | The transition to "Increased_Osteoporosis_Risk" needs adjustment to reflect the 25% increased risk. | Adjust the distribution for "Increased_Osteoporosis_Risk" to reflect a 25% increase compared to the general population risk. | 0.75 |\n| 44 | The risk of atrial fibrillation in patients with uncontrolled HT is 12.5%, compared to 1-1.5% in the general population. | The module implements this in the "Long_Term_Complications" and "Increased_Atrial_Fibrillation_Risk" states. However, the specific 12.5% risk is not accurately represented. | The transition to "Increased_Atrial_Fibrillation_Risk" needs adjustment to reflect the 12.5% risk. | Adjust the distribution for "Increased_Atrial_Fibrillation_Risk" to reflect a 12.5% risk. | 0.75 |\n| 45 | Long-term risk of cardiovascular mortality is increased by 25% in patients with uncontrolled HT. | The module implements this in the "Long_Term_Complications" and "Increased_Cardiovascular_Mortality_Risk" states. However, the 25% increased risk is not explicitly modeled. | The transition to "Increased_Cardiovascular_Mortality_Risk" needs adjustment to reflect the 25% increased risk. | Adjust the distribution for "Increased_Cardiovascular_Mortality_Risk" to reflect a 25% increase compared to the general population risk. | 0.75 |', 'overall_score': 86.66666666666667, 'review_df': [{'requirement_number': '1', 'Requirement': 'Risk of overt GD, women aged 15-60: 1.35%', 'Explanation': 'The module implements this in the "Determine_HT_Type" state with a distribution of 0.567 for Graves Disease in women under 60.

The RAIU results for TI and the confirmation process are correctly modeled. | The transitions between these states correctly implement the diagnosis confirmation for TI based on RAIU results. | None | 1.0 |\n| 31 | If subclinical HT is present (i.e., T3 and FT4 tests are normal), a period of "watchful waiting" commences, during which the T3 and FT4 should be tested at 4-month intervals. For these patients, 3.5% will progress to overt HT per year. | The module implements this in the "Watchful_Waiting", "Subclinical_Follow_Up", and "Subclinical_T3_FT4_Test" states. The 4-month interval and progression rate are correctly modeled. | The transitions between these states correctly implement the watchful waiting period and progression rate. | None | 1.0 |\n| 32 | Beta-blockers are used for symptomatic relief in 75% of HT patients during initial disease management, particularly those suffering from tachycardia or anxiety. | The module implements this in the "Consider_Beta_Blockers", "Check_Beta_Blocker_Symptoms", and "Prescribe_Beta_Blockers" states. The 75% probability and symptom-based decision are correctly modeled. | The transitions between these states correctly implement the beta-blocker prescription process. | None | 1.0 |\n| 33 | If TI is present, the condition will resolve itself naturally in 1-6 months.

After 15 months of treatment with ATDs, there will be remission in 45% of cases, after which, ATDs are discontinued. | The module implements this in the "Prescribe_ATDs", "ATD_Treatment", and "Evaluate_ATD_Response" states. The treatment duration, remission rate, and exceptions for severe cases are correctly modeled. | The transitions between these states correctly implement the ATD treatment process and outcomes. | None | 1.0 |\n| 35 | For patients prescribed ATDs, monitoring of thyroid hormones (T3 and FT4) is done monthly for the first 3 months from the initial treatment. | The module implements this in the "Monthly_Thyroid_Test" state. The monthly monitoring for the first 3 months is correctly modeled. | The transition to and from "Monthly_Thyroid_Test" correctly implements the monitoring process. | None | 1.0 |\n| 36 | The relapse rate after discontinuation of ATDs is 40% within the first year and 60% within 5 years. | The module implements this in the "ATD_Follow_Up" and "ATD_Relapse_Check" states. The relapse rates for both time periods are correctly modeled. | The transitions between these states correctly implement the relapse rates over time. | None | 1.0 |\n| 37 | If ATD therapy fails to achieve remission after 15 months, or if HT recurs after discontinuation of ATDs, the patient will next receive radioactive iodine therapy (RAI). RAI achieves remission in 85% of cases. | The module implements this in the "RAI_Therapy" and "Evaluate_RAI_Response" states. The RAI treatment and remission rate are correctly modeled. | The transitions to and from "RAI_Therapy" correctly implement the treatment process and outcomes. | None | 1.0 |\n| 38 | Six months after the RAI therapy, the patient\'s thyroid hormones will be retested. If overt HT persists, the 50% of patients will repeat RAI treatment, and other 50% of patients will move to the third-line therapy, surgical intervention. Patients who have received RAI twice but still have HT will also receive surgical intervention. | The module implements this in the "RAI_Follow_Up", "Evaluate_RAI_Response", "Second_RAI", and "Surgical_Intervention" states. The follow-up, retesting, and decision process are correctly modeled. | The transitions between these states correctly implement the RAI follow-up and decision process for further treatment. | None | 1.0 |\n| 39 | Surgical intervention is needed for patients with severe TNG, patients with severe ophthalmopathy, and those for whom ATDs and RAI were ineffective. This is 7.5% of overt HT cases overall. Of surgical patients, 80% receive undergo thyroidectomy (procedure) and 20% receive RFA (procedure). Thyroidectomy has a cure rate of 95% and RFA has a success rate of 75%. Patients for whom RFA fails will subsequently undergo thyroidectomy. | The module implements this in the "Surgical_Intervention", "Thyroidectomy", "RFA", "Thyroidectomy_Success", "Thyroidectomy_Failure", "RFA_Success", and "RFA_Failure" states. The surgical options, success rates, and follow-up procedures are correctly modeled. | The transitions between these states correctly implement the surgical intervention process and outcomes. | None | 1.0 |\n| 40 | After successful RAI or surgical intervention (either thyroidectomy or RFA), the risk of hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone levels) is 85%. For these cases, levothyroxine (medication) is prescribed and continued indefinitely for the life of the patient. | The module implements this in the "Check_Hypothyroidism", "Develop_Hypothyroidism", and "Prescribe_Levothyroxine" states. The risk of hypothyroidism and subsequent treatment are correctly modeled. | The transitions between these states correctly implement the post-treatment hypothyroidism check and management. | None | 1.0 |\n| 41 | Long-term follow-up for overt HT involves annual TSH testing to monitor for recurrence of HT or development of hypothyroidism. | The module implements this in the "Long_Term_Follow_Up" and "Annual_TSH_Test" states. The annual follow-up and testing are correctly modeled. | The transitions to and from these states correctly implement the long-term follow-up process. | None | 1.0 |\n| 42 | 15% of patients with HT have uncontrolled disease, either because they lack access medical care, decline treatment, or are non-compliant with treatments. | The module implements this in the "Determine_Treatment" state with a 15% probability of transitioning to "Uncontrolled_HT". | The transition from "Determine_Treatment" to "Uncontrolled_HT" correctly implements the 15% probability of uncontrolled disease. | None | 1.0 |\n| 43 | Long-term osteoporosis risk is increased by 25% in patients with uncontrolled HT. | The module implements this in the "Long_Term_Complications" and "Increased_Osteoporosis_Risk" states.

There is a 25% probability of transitioning to "Hyperdefecation_Symptom", and the severity range is set to 20-50. | The distributed transition from "HT_Symptom_Hyperdefecation" to "Hyperdefecation_Symptom" uses the correct 0.25 probability. The "Hyperdefecation_Symptom" state uses the correct severity range of 20-50. | none | 1.0 |\n| 22 | Ophthalmopathy: Affects 33% of HT patients with GD, severity range 20-100%.

The symptom states use correct severity ranges. | none | 1.0 |\n| 23 | All patients presenting symptoms of HT should first be tested for T3 and FT4 levels. If subclinical HT is present, then T3 and FT4 tests will be normal. If overt HT is present, tests will reveal elevated T3 and/or elevated FT4. | The module implements this in the "HT_Diagnosis" and "T3_FT4_Test" states. All patients undergo T3 and FT4 testing, with results depending on whether they have subclinical or overt HT. | The direct transition from "HT_Diagnosis" to "T3_FT4_Test" ensures all patients are tested. The conditional transition from "T3_FT4_Test" differentiates between normal and elevated results based on the type of HT. | none | 1.0 |\n| 24 | If initial or follow-up testing reveals overt HT, and palpable thyroid nodules are present, or physiologic signs of GD are unclear, then TRAbs should be measured next. | The module implements this in the "Check_Clear_GD" and "Check_Palpable_Thyroid" states. If clear signs of GD are not present, the module checks for palpable thyroid nodules and proceeds to TRAbs testing if necessary. | The conditional transitions from "Check_Clear_GD" and "Check_Palpable_Thyroid" correctly determine whether TRAbs testing is needed based on the presence of clear GD signs or palpable thyroid nodules. | none | 1.0 |\n| 25 | However, if initial or follow-up testing reveals overt HT and there are no palpable thyroid nodules and there are clear physiologic signs of GD, TRAbs testing is not necessary, and a diagnosis of GD is confirmed. | The module implements this in the "Check_Clear_GD" state. If clear signs of GD are present, the module bypasses TRAbs testing and confirms GD diagnosis. | The conditional transition from "Check_Clear_GD" to "Confirm_GD" occurs when clear signs of GD are present, bypassing unnecessary TRAbs testing. | none | 1.0 |\n| 26 | If TRAbs are elevated, a GD diagnosis is confirmed. TRAbs will be elevated in 98% of cases of GD. | The module implements this in the "TRAbs_Test" and "Elevated_TRAbs" states. For GD cases, there is a 98% probability of elevated TRAbs, leading to GD confirmation. | The conditional transition from "TRAbs_Test" uses the correct 0.98 probability for elevated TRAbs in GD cases. The "Elevated_TRAbs" state leads to GD confirmation. | none | 1.0 |\n| 27 | Alternatively, if TRAbs are normal, radioactive iodine uptake test (RAIU) should be conducted. However, RAIU is contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation, and a thyroid ultrasound with color-flow Doppler procedure should be substituted. | The module implements this in the "Normal_TRAbs", "Check_RAIU_Contraindications", and "Thyroid_Ultrasound" states. If TRAbs are normal, the module checks for RAIU contraindications and substitutes thyroid ultrasound if necessary. | The transitions from "Normal_TRAbs" to "Check_RAIU_Contraindications" and potentially to "Thyroid_Ultrasound" correctly implement this requirement. | none | 1.0 |\n| 28 | If GD is present, RAIU will reveal diffusely increased uptake in 95% of cases, and then GD diagnosis is confirmed. | The module implements this in the "RAIU_Test" and "Diffuse_RAIU" states. For GD cases, there is a 95% probability of diffusely increased uptake, leading to GD confirmation. | The conditional transition from "RAIU_Test" uses the correct 0.95 probability for diffusely increased uptake in GD cases. The "Diffuse_RAIU" state leads to GD confirmation. | none | 1.0 |\n| 29 | Alternatively, if TNG is present, RAIU will reveal focal areas of increased uptake, and then TNG diagnosis is confirmed. Nodules revealed by ultrasound likewise indicate the presence of TNG. | The module implements this in the "RAIU_Test", "Focal_RAIU", and "Confirm_TNG" states. For TNG cases, RAIU reveals focal areas of increased uptake, leading to TNG confirmation. | The conditional transition from "RAIU_Test" to "Focal_RAIU" occurs for TNG cases. The "Focal_RAIU" state leads to TNG confirmation. | none | 1.0 |\n| 30 | Alternatively, if TI is present, RAIU will reveal low or absent uptake, and a diagnosis of TI can be confirmed. | The module implements this in the "RAIU_Test", "Low_RAIU", and "Confirm_TI" states. For TI cases, RAIU reveals low or absent uptake, leading to TI confirmation. | The conditional transition from "RAIU_Test" to "Low_RAIU" occurs for TI cases. The "Low_RAIU" state leads to TI confirmation. | none | 1.0 |\n| 31 | If subclinical HT is present (i.e., T3 and FT4 tests are normal), a period of "watchful waiting" commences, during which the T3 and FT4 should be tested at 4-month intervals. For these patients, 3.5% will progress to overt HT per year. (see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3693616/). | The module implements this in the "Watchful_Waiting", "Subclinical_Follow_Up", and "Subclinical_T3_FT4_Test" states. Subclinical HT patients undergo watchful waiting with 4-month interval testing. The progression rate to overt HT is implemented. | The "Watchful_Waiting" state uses a 4-month delay. The distributed transition from "Subclinical_T3_FT4_Test" uses a 0.0117 probability (3.5% per year) for progression to overt HT. | none | 1.0 |\n| 32 | Beta-blockers are used for symptomatic relief in 75% of HT patients during initial disease management, particularly those suffering from tachycardia or anxiety. | The module implements this in the "Consider_Beta_Blockers" and "Check_Beta_Blocker_Symptoms" states. There is a 75% probability of considering beta-blockers, with prescription based on tachycardia or anxiety symptoms. | The distributed transition from "Consider_Beta_Blockers" uses the correct 0.75 probability. The "Check_Beta_Blocker_Symptoms" state checks for relevant symptoms before prescribing. | none | 1.0 |\n| 33 | If TI is present, the condition will resolve itself naturally in 1-6 months. Beta blockers can be used for symptomatic relief. | The module implements this in the "Monitor_TI", "Resolved_TI", and "Consider_Beta_Blockers_TI" states. TI cases are monitored for 1-6 months, with the option for beta-blocker treatment. | The "Monitor_TI" state uses a 1-6 month delay. The "Consider_Beta_Blockers_TI" state allows for beta-blocker treatment in TI cases. | none | 1.0 |\n| 34 | If overt GD is present, treatment with antithyroid drugs (ATDs) (e.g., methimazole 5-40 mg/d, propylthiouracil 50-150 mg 3 times daily) is first-line therapy, except in cases of severe TNG or severe ophthalmopathy, in which case surgical intervention is the preferred first-line therapy. After 15 months of treatment with ATDs, there will be remission in 45% of cases, after which, ATDs are discontinued. | The module implements this in the "Determine_Treatment", "Prescribe_ATDs", "ATD_Treatment", and "Evaluate_ATD_Response" states. ATDs are prescribed for overt GD cases, except for severe TNG or ophthalmopathy. The 15-month treatment period and 45% remission rate are implemented. | The conditional transitions in "Determine_Treatment" correctly route patients to ATD treatment or surgical intervention based on severity. The "ATD_Treatment" state uses a 15-month delay. The distributed transition from "Evaluate_ATD_Response" uses the correct 0.45 probability for remission. | none | 1.0 |\n| 35 | For patients prescribed ATDs, monitoring of thyroid hormones (T3 and FT4) is done monthly for the first 3 months from the initial treatment. | The module implements this in the "Monthly_Thyroid_Test" state. Patients on ATDs undergo monthly T3 and FT4 tests for the first 3 months. | The "Monthly_Thyroid_Test" state uses a duration of 1-3 months for thyroid hormone monitoring. | none | 1.0 |\n| 36 | The relapse rate after discontinuation of ATDs is 40% within the first year and 60% within 5 years. | The module implements this in the "ATD_Follow_Up" and "ATD_Relapse_Check" states. The relapse rates are correctly implemented for the first year and up to 5 years. | The complex transition in "ATD_Relapse_Check" uses the correct probabilities (0.4 for the first year, additional 0.2 for years 2-5) for relapse. | none | 1.0 |\n| 37 | If ATD therapy fails to achieve remission after 15 months, or if HT recurs after discontinuation of ATDs, the patient will next receive radioactive iodine therapy (RAI). RAI achieves remission in 85% of cases. | The module implements this in the "Evaluate_ATD_Response", "RAI_Therapy", and "Evaluate_RAI_Response" states. Patients who don\'t achieve remission with ATDs or have recurrence receive RAI, with an 85% success rate. | The distributed transition from "Evaluate_ATD_Response" to "RAI_Therapy" occurs for non-remission cases. The distributed transition from "Evaluate_RAI_Response" uses the correct 0.85 probability for RAI success. | none | 1.0 |\n| 38 | Six months after the RAI therapy, the patient\'s thyroid hormones will be retested. If overt HT persists, the 50% of patients will repeat RAI treatment, and other 50% of patients will move to the third-line therapy, surgical intervention. Patients who have received RAI twice but still have HT will also receive surgical intervention. | The module implements this in the "RAI_Follow_Up", "Evaluate_RAI_Response", and "Second_RAI" states. Patients are retested after 6 months, with appropriate probabilities for repeat RAI or surgical intervention. | The "RAI_Follow_Up" state uses a 6-month delay. The distributed transition from "Evaluate_RAI_Response" uses correct probabilities (0.075 each) for repeat RAI and surgical intervention. | none | 1.0 |\n| 39 | Surgical intervention is needed for patients with severe TNG, patients with severe ophthalmopathy, and those for whom ATDs and RAI were ineffective. This is 7.5% of overt HT cases overall. Of surgical patients, 80% receive undergo thyroidectomy (procedure) and 20% receive RFA (procedure). Thyroidectomy has a cure rate of 95% and RFA has a success rate of 75%. Patients for whom RFA fails will subsequently undergo thyroidectomy. | The module implements this in the "Surgical_Intervention", "Thyroidectomy", "RFA", "Thyroidectomy_Success", "Thyroidectomy_Failure", "RFA_Success", and "RFA_Failure" states. The correct probabilities for thyroidectomy vs. RFA and their success rates are implemented. | The distributed transition from "Surgical_Intervention" uses correct probabilities (0.8 for thyroidectomy, 0.2 for RFA). The success rates for thyroidectomy (0.95) and RFA (0.75) are correctly implemented.

If subclinical HT is present, then T3 and FT4 tests will be normal. If overt HT is present, tests will reveal elevated T3 and/or elevated FT4. | This requirement is implemented in the "HT_Diagnosis" and "T3_FT4_Test" states. All patients undergo T3 and FT4 tests, with results depending on whether they have subclinical or overt HT. | The direct transition from "HT_Diagnosis" to "T3_FT4_Test" ensures all patients are tested. The conditional transition in "T3_FT4_Test" correctly differentiates between subclinical and overt HT results. | none | 1.0 |\n| 24 | If initial or follow-up testing reveals overt HT, and palpable thyroid nodules are present, or physiologic signs of GD are unclear, then TRAbs should be measured next. | This requirement is implemented in the "Check_Clear_GD" and "Check_Palpable_Thyroid" states. If clear signs of GD are not present, the module checks for palpable thyroid nodules and proceeds to TRAbs testing if necessary. | The conditional transitions in "Check_Clear_GD" and "Check_Palpable_Thyroid" correctly implement this decision-making process. | none | 1.0 |\n| 25 | However, if initial or follow-up testing reveals overt HT and there are no palpable thyroid nodules and there are clear physiologic signs of GD, TRAbs testing is not necessary, and a diagnosis of GD is confirmed. | This requirement is implemented in the "Check_Clear_GD" state. If clear signs of GD are present, the module bypasses TRAbs testing and proceeds directly to GD diagnosis. | The conditional transition in "Check_Clear_GD" correctly bypasses TRAbs testing when clear signs of GD are present. | none | 1.0 |\n| 26 | If TRAbs are elevated, a GD diagnosis is confirmed. TRAbs will be elevated in 98% of cases of GD. | This requirement is implemented in the "TRAbs_Test" and "Elevated_TRAbs" states. For GD cases, there is a 0.98 probability of elevated TRAbs, leading to GD diagnosis confirmation. | The conditional transition in "TRAbs_Test" correctly implements the 98% probability of elevated TRAbs for GD cases. | none | 1.0 |\n| 27 | Alternatively, if TRAbs are normal, radioactive iodine uptake test (RAIU) should be conducted. However, RAIU is contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation, and a thyroid ultrasound with color-flow Doppler procedure should be substituted. | This requirement is implemented in the "Normal_TRAbs", "Check_RAIU_Contraindications", and "Thyroid_Ultrasound" states. If TRAbs are normal, the module checks for RAIU contraindications and proceeds to either RAIU or thyroid ultrasound accordingly. | The transitions from "Normal_TRAbs" to "Check_RAIU_Contraindications" and then to either "RAIU_Test" or "Thyroid_Ultrasound" correctly implement this decision-making process. | none | 1.0 |\n| 28 | If GD is present, RAIU will reveal diffusely increased uptake in 95% of cases, and then GD diagnosis is confirmed. | This requirement is implemented in the "RAIU_Test" and "Diffuse_RAIU" states. For GD cases, there is a 0.95 probability of diffusely increased uptake, leading to GD diagnosis confirmation. | The conditional transition in "RAIU_Test" correctly implements the 95% probability of diffusely increased uptake for GD cases. | none | 1.0 |\n| 29 | Alternatively, if TNG is present, RAIU will reveal focal areas of increased uptake, and then TNG diagnosis is confirmed. Nodules revealed by ultrasound likewise indicate the presence of TNG. | This requirement is implemented in the "RAIU_Test", "Focal_RAIU", and "Thyroid_Ultrasound" states. For TNG cases, RAIU reveals focal areas of increased uptake, or nodules are detected by ultrasound, leading to TNG diagnosis confirmation. | The conditional transitions in "RAIU_Test" and "Thyroid_Ultrasound" correctly implement the diagnosis process for TNG. | none | 1.0 |\n| 30 | Alternatively, if TI is present, RAIU will reveal low or absent uptake, and a diagnosis of TI can be confirmed. | This requirement is implemented in the "RAIU_Test" and "Low_RAIU" states.
